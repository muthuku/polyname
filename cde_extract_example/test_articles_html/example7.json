They represent an easy way of chemically bonding polymers to silica. Two processes have been considered: polymerization from a coupling agent grafted on the surface; and reaction of a prefunctionalized polymer by condensation of its alkoxy head with silanols of the surface. Each of them has advantages and limitations. We focus here on the `onto' grafting mechanism. The main advantages are the control of polymerization degree in the first step of polymer synthesis which occurs in a homogeneous medium and the easy polymer characterization of the soluble precursor. The semi-batch procedure avoids molecular weight shift and broadening with conversion. Grafting efficiency is measured in function of polymer chain length, which indicates a steric limitation by the silica pore size. Trialkoxy silanes are more reactive than monoalkoxy for silica coverage and exhibit a better chemical resistance.

Introduction Supported reagents, based on either polymer or silica, have, for many years, been the subject of experimentation. This paper deals with recent results on controlled polymer grafting `from' and `onto' silica. In the first process, the polymer grows from the surface by reaction between the bonded silane coupling agent with the monomer. In the second process, the polymerization is run in a homogeneous medium in the presence of a transfer agent. The alkoxysilyl terminated polymer is then coupled with the silanol groups of the support. * Corresponding author.

For instance it is used as stationary bonded phases for chromatography [1], in emulsion chemistry for stabilizing colloidal dispersion of silica particles [2], and in catalysis [3]. This latter application is considered in this work in order to synthesize heterogeneous acid catalysts. Silica is chosen as a support because of its high mechanical resistance, its high thermal stability and its chemical reactivity through the silanol groups. These characteristics, combined with the versatility of copolymer synthesis, has such advantages as: improvement of number of sites; compatibility adaptation between reagents and catalyst; and adequate choice of local site environment. Proper derivatization of polymers has unlimited 106 A. Revillon, D. Leroux/ Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 105-118 potential in obtaining reactive supported polymers. Silica texture must be of a given porosity in order to present a compromise between sufficient surface area (governing number of sites) and accessibility into the pores. The particle size must be large enough to perform fixed bed catalytic tests. Catalysts are prepared in 3 steps: polymer synthesis; grafting of polymer; and functionalization, e.g. sulfonation to generate sulfonic acid catalytic sites. This last step will not be considered in this paper. The general principle is to use a silane which is a bifunctional coupling agent. It is terminated at one end by an alkoxy function, which is active in condensation reaction with silanols and at the other end by a function active in radical polymerization. An advantage of the alkoxysilane coupling agent is the better resistance of Si-O-Si bond as compared to -C-O- bonds, which are very sensitive to hydrolysis. Several examples of silica priming have been presented [4]. Here, we focus on two grafting processes using a thiol coupling agent, active in chain transfer. In the so-called `from' grafting [5-9], monomer is polymerized with silica prefunctionalized by a transfer agent, so that polymer chains are growing `from' the surface. Another procedure, which is called `onto' grafting silica silanols are reacted with a silylalkoxyterminated polymer, this polymer being synthesized prior grafting. Both methods have advantages and limitations. The aim of the present work is to compare the `from' and `onto' processes: mechanism of the polystyrene functionalization by a thioalkoxysilane, characterization of the `onto' polymer, measurements of the grafting efficiency, effect of silane functionality and characterization of the final grafted silica. After determining chain transfer constants, a program has been operated for continuous addition of the coupling agent. Series of polymers of different molecular weight (MW) have been prepared and grafted at different extents onto silica. Evidence of covalent bonds has been brought through solid 29Si-NMR CP-MAS. MWs have been measured after silica dissolution. Some of the fundamental results are: molecular weight of grafted and non-grafted polymers are different (except for the low molecular weight polymer grafted by the `onto' process), molecular weight distributions are different in these two processes and vary with conversion. In the case of the `onto' grafting, silica pore size affects the grafting efficiency and the molecular weight distribution. 2. Experimental 2.1. First step: alkoxyterminated polystyrene synthesis Toluene is dried over molecular sieves (3 A). Styrene is distilled to eliminate the inhibitor (tert4-butylpyrocatechol). The transfer agents mercapto-methyldimethylethoxysilane (monoalkoxysilane, MAS) and mercapto-propyltrimethoxysilane (trialkoxysilane, TAS) are Aldrich products used without further purification. Polymerization of styrene is carried out in toluene at 80 under argon. In a typical experiment, transfer agent (0.1-2 g), styrene (56 g), AIBN (0.04-0.2 g) are mixed together in toluene (233 g). When polymerization is started, a solution of MAS or TAS (1-10% in weight) is continuously added to the batch solution via a syringe at a constant flow rate (0.1-1 ml/h). Reaction is stopped after about 6 h by adding an inhibitor such as hydroquinone. Alkoxyterminated polystyrene is recovered by evaporating the solution under vacuum. The final product is characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and for some of them by 1H-NMR, IRFT and elemental analysis. 2.2. Second step: grafting of polymer onto silica Silica (Grace MP350) with a volume average pore diameter 32 nm, surface area 170 M2/g, porous volume 1.7 ml/g (our experimental values) and bead diameter 0.5-1 mm was dried for 5 h at 200 under argon. The silanol density is measured by titration with triethylaluminum A. Revillon, D. Leroux/ Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 105-118 (0.8 mEq SiOH/g silica). Morphology is characterized by mercury porosimetry. In a typical experiment, 10 g of functionalized polystyrene and 5 g of silica are mixed in 250 ml of toluene (or mesitylene) and heated under argon at 110 (or 160) for 24 h. Grafted silica is then filtered, submitted to a Soxhlet extraction in toluene for 24 h and dried under vacuum at 80 for at least 3 h. The final product is characterized by mercury porosimetry, elemental analysis (sulfur, carbon), thermogravimetry and by solid CP-MAS z9SiNMR. 2.3. Recovery of the grafted polystyrene Functionalized silica (5 g) was dissolved in aqueous fluorhydric acid 40% (50 ml), in the presence of toluene (10 ml) at 60 for 24 h. The polymer was simultaneously extracted from aqueous phase by toluene. After decantation, the upper organic phase was separated and evaporated under vacuum. 2.4. Measurements of the grafting yield Grafting yield has been measured from carbon and silicon elemental analysis (EA) and from thermogravimeric analysis (TGA). In the latter case, the weight loss of grafted silica after complete combustion of polymer gives, in first approximation, the polymer mass per gram of functionalized silica. A typical TGA diagram (Fig. 1) shows one large weight loss between 330 and 600 (curve 1). If residual toluene solvent is still present after drying, another weight loss is observed between 90 and 190. An excellent correlation (Fig. 2) is observed between the grafting yield values obtained by elemental analysis and TGA. Condensation of silanols groups is associated with the elimination of water. This weight loss can be measured in the analysis of initial silica. It occurs at a temperature between 330 and 550 (curve 2).

Data acquisition and interpretation were realized with a laboratory-made program. Morphology was studied with the help of a Micromeritics Autopore 9220. Pore diameter distribution was determined from incremental mercury intrusion up to a pressure of 400 MPa. TGA was operated with an Ugine-Eyraud balance. 3. Results 3.1. Results from the `grafting from' process Reacting silica with a functional alkoxy silane has been operated by the use of a trialkoxysilane, bearing either an initiator moeity, or a comonomer (acrylic) unit or a thiol one [4]. One of the limitations of this priming extent was that part of the silanol sites were covered by the relatively large grafted moeities. A second reason limiting the extent of grafting of polymer was the progressive inaccessibility of these grafted coupling sites by the nascent polymer. To obtain a precursor of functional polymer, vinyl benzyl chloride was polymerized [5]. The highest amounts of grafts resulted from the use of the azo initiator (prepared by reaction between aminopropyltriethoxysilane and azobiscyanovaleric acid) most often doubly bound to the surface. Reasonably high amounts of grafted chains were also obtained by copolymerization with trimethoxypropylmethacrylate. In this case, each polymer chain was bound by several points to the silica. Lowest values of grafted chains resulted from the use of thiopropyltriethoxysilane. Moreover it is evident that chain length increased with conversion due to the decrease of the number of thiols and the decrease of their accessibility. The result was a broad molecular weight distribution (MWD) [9]. Morphological studies showed that the polymer is in an elongated structure when bound by only one point. It was only in this case that silica dissolution by HF attack was effective in obtaining a soluble polymer, able to be characterized. For this reason (need for a proper characterization) as well as the necessity to synthesize a grafted polymer of a narrow MWD and also the continuous and rapid decrease of active grafted species with conversion by a masking effect, led us to move to the `onto' grafting process [10,11]. 3.2. Synthesis of the alkoxyterminated polymer by `grafting onto' process In the first step, styrene monomer is polymerized (with AIBN as initiator in toluene) in the presence of a highly reactive chain transfer agent, so that termination is essentially due to transfer, which generates a new radical bearing an alkoxysilyl group. In the second step, alkoxysilylterminated polystyrene is reacted by (inter)condensation with silanols groups of silica. It has been observed that the mercapto-propyltrimethoxysilane (TAS) has an effective functionality between I and 2, instead of the expected 3. Yet, further (intra)condensation may occur between the free residual alkoxy groups of neighboring coupling agents. In order to separate interand intracondensation, a monoalkoxy analog has been used: mercapto-methyldimethylethoxysilane (MAS), which is monobonded to the support. Conversely, the trialkoxysilane gives rise to a multibonded polymer. This grafted polymer is more resistant to chemicals. Moreover the intra-alkoxy condensation generates a protective surface layer by masking hydrophilic silanols and decreasing sensitivity to alkaline media. Mechanism of `onto' grafting reaction, calculation of polymer functionalities and results of chemical analysis will be discussed elsewhere in more detail [12]. Only a few remarks are reported here: 3 types of polymer are synthesized, the unfunctionalized polymer (PS), the mono- and difunctionalized polymer. Fraction of pure PS is to be minimized as it cannot be grafted. Moreover Vincent et al. [13] have shown that the presence of an unfunctionalized polymer diminishes the reaction yield A. Revillon, D. Leroux /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 105-118 because of competitive adsorption. Influence of the polymerization medium composition on the final average functionality can be determined by calculation of each fraction of polymer, using Ikada et al.'s theory [14]. 3.2.1. Semi-batch polymerization by addition of transfer agent A major problem that we met during batch polymerization was the fast depletion of the transfer agent resulting in a broadening of the MWD. In Fig. 3, the conversion curves of monomer, initiator and transfer agent are represented according to the classical equations written below. [S]t is calculated by integration of dS/dt: d[S]/[S] = ktr{2fkdlo/kc}s{exp(-kdt)}s dt In [S]t/[S]o - 2kt,/kd{2fkdlo/kc}o.s x [{exp -kdt}a.5 _ 1] The same for [M], and [1]t: In [Mo]/[M]t = 2kP/kd{fkdktlo}o.5 x {1 - exp(-kdt/2)} [1]t = [10] exp(-kdt) Values of kinetic constants kP, kd, kr are from Ref.

Calculated conversion of monomer, initiator and transfer agent in a batch experiment. 109 In our first experiments, reaction was limited at low transfer agent conversion to avoid changes in relative concentration of reagents. Of course, this method was not suitable for synthesizing high quantities of `onto' polymer. To overcome this problem, an alternative is to proceed via a semi-batch polymerization. Transfer agent (S) was added to the batch polymerization solution at such a flow rate that its concentration was kept constant. The initial addition flow rate (Fo) can be calculated from the transfer and initiating rates as below: F = (-d[S]/dt) Vp, MM(S)/[S]W where: -d[S]/dt = ktr{2fka/kt}o.s[l]o.s[S]r VPS = volume of the polymerization solution (ml), MM(S) = molar mass of the transfer agent, [S]W = transfer agent concentration in the added solution (g/I). To determine the transfer rate constant, ktr, we measured the two transfer constants C (ktr/kP) by plotting the Mayo function 1/DP= f ([S]). They are in agreement with published values [16] for such mercaptans: 6 and 5 for TAS and MAS, respectively. Comparison of experiments semi-batch (SB)/ batch (B) show that SB is an efficient answer for getting a lower broadening of the GPC diagrams. When transfer agent is added continuously IP is about 1.8 instead of 2.4 (after 6 h reaction). Moreover, it remains constant with time (Table 1). In a batch experiment, AIBN initiator and the transfer agent are very rapidly consumed at 80 (Fig. 3). In our semi-batch experiments, transfer agent was kept constant by its addition at a determined flow rate. In fact, it should be adjusted during the polymerization since the rate of the transfer reaction is lowered when the initiator concentration decreases. The reaction rate is also decreased and the conversion reaches a limited value (dead-end Tobolsky polymerization). The instantaneous DP should increase with as 110 A. Revillon, D. Leroux/Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 105-118 consequence a broadening of the MWD, in addition to the broadening effect due to the transfer agent depletion. In the future, the initiator should be also added to the solution of polymerization, in order to perform a more controlled synthesis and increase the maximum conversion. 3.2.2. Grafting of alkoxyterminated polystyrene on silica Two types of polymer terminated by monoalkoxy- (MAS) and trialkoxysilane (TAS) have been characterized. Condensation on silica was performed at two temperatures 110 and 160. A few parameters to be defined are: G m (polymer) = m (silica + polymer) Initial weight ratio: r,, = moP/moSi Number ratio: r= noPg/noSiOH Condensation yield: Rc = nPg/noP Functionalization yield: Grafting yield: Rf = nPg/noSiOH where nPg = number of polymer moles per gram of grafted silica, m = mass, noP = number of initial polymer moles per gram of silica, Pg = grafted polymer, noSiOH = number of silanols per gram of silica.

Values of grafting yield (G) and condensation yield (R, ,) versus the polymerization degree (DP are shown in Table 2 and Figs. 4 and 5. We can see that the grafting efficiency G is approximatively 3 times greater when trialkoxysilane, instead of monoalkoxy, is used as the coupling agent. The reaction probability of a molecule terminated by 3 functional groups must, of course, be greater than that of a monofunctional molecule. We assume that TAS cannot be fixed to silica by more than two siloxane bonds (for steric considerations). Yet condensation between the third free methoxysilane group and a new polymer chain should, in principle, be possible. In fact, because of steric limitations, this last reaction should not be important. Higher reactivity of the trimethoxy group towards condensation may also explain a higher grafting ratio.

This can be explained if we assume that the grafted polymer chains mask neighboring silanols and avoid further condensation reaction. The grafted mass of polymer increases slowly with the DP values: when DP is multiplied by 10, G increases by a factor of only 1.8. Maximum grafting yield is obtained with high DP values of 200 (compared to DP = 20) at low condensation yield 1% (compared to 10%). The size of the polymer to be grafted should be limited by steric hindrance. This point is discussed in the next paragraph. 3.2.3. Steric hindrance limitations SEC analysis of the grafted polymer. The evolution of the functionalization yield versus DP indicates that low MW polymer is more reactive towards grafting than high MW polymer. At first, we assumed that the differences in the grafting yield came from a phenomenon of steric hindrance in the silica pores. So we compared the SEC diagrams of the polymer before and after grafting. After dissolution of silica in fiuorhydric acid [17] grafted polymer is recovered, as described in the experimental part. Five samples have been analyzed which are terminated either by a mono- or a trialkoxysilane. Their DP varies from 9 to 550. SEC diagrams are presented with their normalized areas (magnified distribution may show some signal at values apparently absent in the parent polymer). Polymers before and after grafting are shown in Fig. 6a and b.

Observed shifts could be explained, assuming condensation between the alkoxy groups of the polymer after HF treatment, as observed with model compounds in Ref. [18]. We then considered the effect of HF treatment on grafted polymer. Comparison of MWD analysis of the functionalized polymer before and after HF treatment (precursor polymer and degrafted polymer) shows a difference in normalized distribution. That means that a small fraction of polymer corresponding to the high MW polymer has not been grafted. As the areas of both peaks are equal in the chosen presentation, the fraction of low MW polymer appears to be higher after grafting has occurred. Beyond this evidence of a preferential grafting of the low MW fraction of the initial polymer, an effect of the initial MWD is observed. The difference increases with the polymerization degree (from MM23 to MM21 and from MP29 to MP30). The maximum MW value of the grafted polymer is about 20,000 for MM23 and about 100,000 for MM21 and MP30. The values of these limits are rather different, so the hypothesis of a fixed frontier where support steric hindrance should occur independently of the initial polymer distribution seems to be too simple a model. Comparison of polymer radius of gyration versus pore radius. Porous volume is obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry. By assuming a hypothesis on the pore geometry (cylinder model), incremental pressure values may correspond to pore diameters. Differential pore diameter distribution in volume of the initial silica `MP350' and of the grafted silica have been compared. In initial silica, the distribution is relatively narrow: pore diameters lay between 10 and 60 nm with a volume average diameter at 32 nm. A second maximum at about 0.1 mm corresponds to the intergranular void. After grafting, the specific surface area and the porous volume have decreased to 71 and 66%, respectively, of their initial values, as indicated in Table 4. The volume Table 4 Morphology of initial and grafted silica MP350 MP26 S,p (M2/g) (granular) VP (ml/g) (granular) S,P (M2/g) (intergranular) VP (ml/g) (intergranular) DP= 73; Rc = 2.3%; G = 142 mg/g. 170 1.7 0.006 0.29 120 1.10 0.064 0.40 occupied by polystyrene, evaluated from its solid state density (1.06) and the grafting yield (G = 142 mg Pol/g Si) is about 0.15 ml. This value is low, compared to the 0.6 ml difference of porous volume before and after grafting. A simple explanation could be that cylindrical pores have been closed by polymer, so that a void volume is becoming inaccessible to mercury. Grafted polymer has a sectional area varying from 3.5 (DP = 10) to 40 nm2 (DP = 100). The latter value is very high as compared to the average silanol area which is about 0.36 nm2, which is estimated from the surface area and a silanol density of 0.8 mmol/g. Silanols, in the neighborhood of a grafted polymer chain, should be inaccessible to further reaction because of a masking effect due to the already grafted polymer. The fraction of accessible silanols decreases faster than expected from observed rate of the only condensation reaction between silanols and alkoxy groups. This interpretation could partially explain the very low grafting yield which is observed. Another simple approach is to compare the diameter of gyration (Dg = 2Rg) of polystyrene in toluene (Fig. 7a, calculated from data obtained from Ref. [15]) to the pore diameter (2Rp). We can draw the fraction of silanol groups included in pores greater than a fixed diameter and compare it to the gyration diameter of polystyrene. This number fraction of silanols is calculated from the surface distribution and the silanol average density (Fig. 7b, from mercury porosimetry measurements). If we make the simple assumption that a polymer cannot penetrate inside a pore with a diameter smaller than the polymer Dg, we see that a molecule with a DP higher than 200 (corresponding to Dg higher A. Revillon, D. Leroux/ Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 105-118 113 than 10 nm) could only have access to part of the silanols. Since these assumptions are very simple. It would be very hazardous to use these results for quantitative interpretation. Yet, we can conclude that support steric selection may effectively occur with low MW polymer in the grafting of this porous silica. To summarize, results fit both hypotheses for explaining the low grafting yield observed: steric limitations and masking effect of unreacted silanols which is brought by grafted polymer chains. 2.2.4. Evidence of the silica-grafted polymer from solid 29Si-NMR analysis Polymer adheres to the silica in varying degrees. Studies have shown that 3 kinds of polymer can be distinguished: physisorbed, chemisorbed and grafted [19]. Weakly bonded physisorbed polymer can be removed from the support by simple washing. Chemisorbed polymer, more strongly bonded, can be removed from the support by a toluene Soxhlet extraction at 110. Grafted polymer is covalently bonded to the support and can be removed only by chemical reaction. The products have been submitted to a 24-h extraction in toluene, so that remaining polymer is considered to be strongly bonded to silica. However, it is not a definitive proof. Z9Si-NMR analysis was used to directly prove the existence of a covalent siloxane bond between alkoxyterminated polystyrene and silica. Spectra of MAS (1), silica after grafting of MAS (2) and after grafting of alkoxy-terminated polystyrene (3) are presented in Table 5 with assignments of chemical shifts. An important remark is that a liquid simply impregnating the support cannot be visualized in solid NMR because of its too high mobility. So the observation of an absorption peak indicates at first that the molecule is strongly bonded to the support. Analysis of initial silica spectrum has been published previously [4]. New assignments are proposed by comparison with model or similar 114 A. Revillon, D.

For that, we attempted to determine the effects of condensation reactions on chemical shifts. Initial reagents. A single peak at 16.2 ppm in spectrum I of MMDMES is similar to that of analog Et-O-Si-(Me)3 at 14 ppm.

Spectrum II for thiol after reaction with silica presents a high intensity signal at 11.5 ppm, which is due to a high grafting ratio (45). The change of -6 ppm in chemical shift between free and grafted thiol is in agreement with the observed peak in the parent reaction (a). In consequence, thiol is covalently bounded to silica via Si-O-Si. Absorption at 10 ppm indicates the presence of grafted polymer in spectrum III for MMDMES terminated polystyrene via `onto' process. The effect of a substituent in g position of Si is low, so the chemical shift is close for grafted thiol and grafted polymer (difference is -2 ppm). We did not succeed in assigning absorptions at -14.9 and -5 ppm; they are not present in the `grafted from' polymer. Low intensity for the coupling agent results in the low covering amount: only 4% of reacted silanols. Relative changes in peak intensity between silanols (at -100 ppm, formula 8) and tetracoordinated 116 A. Revillon, D. Leroux/ Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 105-118 Si atoms in the solid (at -110 ppm, formula 9) allow a comparison of the grafting ratio for the different samples. For the `grafting from' polymer (spectrum IV), the interpretation is similar to the above. Absorptions at -14.9 and -5 ppm are not detected (perhaps due a less high scan number). Polymer having reacted with the trifunctional siloxane (spectrum VI) may be bonded to the support theoretically via 1, 2 or 3 bonds (this latter probability is extremely low). Absorptions at -48 and -56 ppm have been assigned, respectively, to polymer bonded by one and two siloxane bonds (reaction is similar to (b)). 3.2.5. Characterization of the alkoxyterminated polystyrene Four methods have been used: SEC, NMR, IRFT and chemical analysis. SEC analysis provides the molecular weight distribution (MWD) characterized by the polymerization degree (DP and the polymolecularity index (IP). The thioalkoxysilane head of the polymer has been assumed to have no influence on the exclusion behavior. Since our objective was to minimize the IP value and to control the polymer length, SEC analysis was systematically performed for measuring results of each synthesis. An important comment is that free transfer agent does not remain in the sample: the poly- a mer is precipitated in methanol (in which the transfer agent is soluble), filtered and then dried under vacuum. DPNMR of the polymer functionalized by MAS is calculated from the intensity ratio of aromatic proton signal I (Harp) to that of the methyl groups bonded to the silicon atom Hsi-Met: _ I (Harp) I (HSi-Met) DP~,NMR 8 ) / ( 6 Since the accuracy of the NMR method decreases when MW increases, the analyzed sample should have, where possible, a low DP value. Effectively, polymers of low DP (DP = 20) have been successfully analyzed by 1H-NMR. The NMR spectra of the alkoxyterminated polymer (Fig. 8) and the pure transfer agent MAS (Fig. 9) show that transfer is effective. A good agreement is obtained between DP calculated from NMR data (DPNMR = 10.8) and the DP calculated from SEC data (DPn,sEC = 11). It shows us neither free transfer agent subsist in the polymer, nor unfunctionalized polymer in this sample. Otherwise, the DPNMR should be higher, respectively lower than the DP,,, SEC - Comparison of the IRFT spectra of MAS (Fig. 10c), atactic polystyrene (Fig. l0a) and functionalized polymer (Fig. lob) shows that two absorption bands can be attributed without doubt to the alkoxysilane chain extremity.

Again this observation is only valid for short polymer chains (otherwise an overlap occurs between the PS peak at 1069 cm-1 and the Si-O-C absorption). The Si-O-C absorption disappears when the polymer is voluntarily hydrolyzed. In consequence, IRFT is a valid way to check that the Si-O-R groups are still present. 4. Conclusions In the `onto' grafting process, the advantages are: - the easy characterization of the polymer be fore grafting; - the possibility of controlling the polymer chain length by monitoring addition of the transfer agent. The result is a narrow molecular weight distribution centered on the adequate value; - the well-known mechanism of homogeneous polymerization and the numerous kinetics data available in the literature; - the high expected accessibility to the polymer chains. Since large size molecules of polymer have to diffuse before grafting, the resulting grafted silica area should be very accessible to smaller reactants (in a catalytic reaction); Q, 7s - u c a .~62 49 96 23 701 4000 3600 3200 2800 2400 2000 1600 7200 800400 Wavenumber toz 94.5 I 86.61 78.7 c 70.8 62.9 ss.o I 4000 3575 3150 2725 2300 78751450 Wavenumber t a I-CH2-CH31 7390 b I-Si-GH3 17252.5 c-Si-O-CH211162 d 1-51-0-G 11107*10e1 e I -Si-GH3 1793.5 ' f 1-0-CH2 2924+2902 by 9 I-6i-CH3 297 II7 ~d 63.9 I 3 55.5 1 n 3200 2850 2500 27150 7600 1450 1100 750 400 Wavenumber Fig. 10.

Leroux/ Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 105-118 - silanol sites are in a larger number as compared to the active sites formed by reacting the coupling agents of the from process and may react uniformly with preformed alkoxy terminated polymer. In the `from' grafting process, advantages are: - many possibilities for priming the surface with a coupling agent active in initiation, copolymerization or transfer in radical polymerization; - easy characterization of the silica surface after priming; - choice of the extent of coupling, which means extent of grafted thiol agent; - easy reaction between priming agents and radicals or monomer. Both processes are still under study in the labo- ratory. Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to Dr A.

Two processes have been considered: polymerization from a coupling agent grafted on the surface; and reaction of a prefunctionalized polymer by condensation of its alkoxy head with silanols of the surface. Each of them has advantages and limitations. We focus here on the \u2018onto\u2019 grafting mechanism. The main advantages are the control of polymerization degree in the first step of polymer synthesis which occurs in a homogeneous medium and the easy polymer characterization of the soluble precursor. The semi-batch procedure avoids molecular weight shift and broadening with conversion. Grafting efficiency is measured in function of polymer chain length, which indicates a steric limitation by the silica pore size. Trialkoxy silanes are more reactive than monoalkoxy for silica coverage and exhibit a better chemical resistance.
