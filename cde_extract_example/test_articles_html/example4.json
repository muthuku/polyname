This paper describes the photochromic behaviour of poly(a-amino acid)s containing azobenzene and spiropyran groups in the side chains, and illustrates the most significative examples of their photoresponse effects. Experimental findings provide evidence that the molecular and supramolecular structure of these polypeptides can be photomodulated using the photosensitive side chains as effectors. The extent and the kind of photoresponse, including photoinduced coil -. a-helix transitions, photostimulated aggregation/disaggregation processes, reversible variations of viscosity and solubility, were found to depend on polymer and environment conditions. Interpretative models of the photoresponse effects indicate that photochromic poly(a-amino acid) systems actually behave as amplifiers and transducers of the primary photochemical event occurring in the side chains, and therefore may be promising materials for application in optical technology.

Introduction Photochromic compounds exhibit variation of their colour, or more generally of their absorption spectra when exposed to light. They regain their original colour spontaneously, when placed in the dark, or by irradiation in the spectral region of the induced absorption. This phenomenon is due to the capability of the photochromic compounds to exist in two different states, for instance two isomeric struc- * Corresponding author. 1381-5148/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved. SSDI1381-5148(95)00006-2 tures, whose relative concentration depends on the wavelength of the incident light [1,2]. Fig. 1 shows the photoreactions of two of the most comprehensively investigated photochromic systems: azobenzene [3] and spiropyran compounds [4]. In aromatic azo compounds, the photochromism is due to the trans -. cis photoisomerization around the N=N double bond; in spiropyrans, the photochromism involves the isomerization between the colourless closed spiro structure and the coloured open merocyanine structure, via heterolytic cleavage of the spiro oxygen-carbon bond. 186 O. Pieroni et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 185-199 The occurrence of two different states which can be reversibly switched from one to another by means of an external light stimulus, can be the basis for a so-called molecular switch [5]. Moreover, when photochromic molecules are incorporated in polymer matrices, their photoisomerization can induce conformational changes of the surrounding macromolecules, which, in turn, may be accompanied by variations of the physical and chemical properties of materials, such as photoinduced variations of optical rotatory power, photostimulated variations of viscosity and solubility, photocontrol of membrane functions, photomechanical effects. Therefore, photochromic polymers may be highly promising materials for application in optical technology, as well as in development of devices which can be photoregulated. Some fine reviews on different aspects of photochromic polymers have appeared in the last few years [6-8]. Here we will review the investigations carried out on photochromic poly(a-amino acid)s. As far as structural and conformational variations is concerned, poly(a-amino acid)s with photochromic side chains are quite attractive systems. In fact, they can exist in disordered or regularly folded chains such as a-helix and tructure. Moreover the photostimulated orderdisorder conformational changes of the macromolecules occur as cooperative transitions, thus amplifying the perturbation due to the photoreactions of the chromophores attached to the side chains. Examination of the mechanisms and discussion of the driving forces responsible for the photoresponse provide evidence that these systems actually behave as amplifiers and transducers of the primary photochemical event occurring in the photosensitive side chains, thus suggesting their potential technological application. 2.

The photochromic behaviour of these macromolecules is due to the photoisomerization of azobenzene units (Fig. 1). At room temperature in the dark, all azo groups are in the traps configuration, which is planar and fully conjugated. Irradiation produces the isomerization to the cis configuration which, by contrast, is not planar for steric reasons and the two benzene rings are forced to stay in skewed planes. As a consequence of the different electronic situation, the two isomers have markedly different absorption and the photo-isomerization is accompanied by strong variations of the spectra (Fig. 2). In particular, the traps --* cis isomerization is revealed by a strong decrease of the intense band at about 350 nm associated with a 7r -7r * transition, and a contemporary increase of the band at 450 nm associated with the n-n transition of the azo chromophore [9]. At the photostationary state, the relative composition of the two isomers depends only on the incident light. The maximum photoconversion to the cis isomer (85%) is achieved by irradiating at 340370 nm, whereas the maximum yield of the back reaction from the cis to the traps isomer (80%) is achieved by irradiating at 450 run.

Reversible light-induced variations of the absorption spectra in azo-modified poly(L-glutamic acid). 200-W lamp, irradiation for 1 or 2 min is enough to achieve the photostationary state. The thermal decay in the dark is much slower. At room temperature, it takes more than 200 h to restore the full-trans isomeric composition [9]. The photochromic cycles are completely reversible and can be repeated at will, without any apparent fatigue. 2.2. Photoregulation of conformation in solution In a pioneering work, Goodman et al. [10] reported a change in the chiroptical properties of p-phenylazo-phenylalanine polymers. The optical activity change was the result of the traps --* cis isomerization of the azo units, but was not the consequence of photoinduced variations of the macromolecular secondary structure. Photoinduced conformational changes in polypeptides were first reported by Ueno et al. [11,12]. Copolymers of p-phenylazo-benzylL-aspartate and benzyl-L-aspartate (Scheme 1) exhibited a positive CD band at about 220 nm which was attributed to the presence of a lefthanded helix. The change in the sign of the CD band after irradiation at 330-380 nn was taken as an indication of the reversal of the he- 187 ,'~-NH-- 2 CO I O C H2 N~ N 6 CO-A,/-NH-CH-CO--'\\r 7 CO I O Scheme 1. p-Phenylazobenzyl- and benzyl-L-aspartate residues. lix sense of the polypeptide chains. Large effects were observed in solvent mixtures, provided the irradiation was carried out at a critical solvent composition [13-15]. A copolypeptide containing 8 mol% of azo residues was left-handed helical in pure dichloroethane (DCE), while it was right-handed helical in pure trimethylphosphate (TMP). The inversion occurred between 20 and 50% TMP; however, the TMP dependence of the conformation was different for the dark-adapted sample and the irradiated one, so remarkable effects on CD spectra were obtained when irradiation was carried out between 20 and 50% TMP content. At 28% TMP, irradiation produced an inversion of the 220 nm CD band, indicating a conformational variation from left-handed helix to right-handed helix [13-15]. Analogous photoresponse effects have been recently obtained on a new series of copolymers containing pphenylazo-benzyl-L-aspartate and n-octadecyl-Laspartate residues, provided the irradiation is carried out under appropriate solvent and temperature conditions [16]. In organic solvents such as trimethylphosphate and trifluoroethanol, azo-modified poly(Lglutame)s illustrated in Scheme 2 show the typical CD curve of the a-helix structure, with two minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 3) [9]. Above 250 nn, the dark-adapted samples also exhibit an intense couplet of bands centred at 350 nm, in correspondence of the >r-n * tran- 188 0.

Azo-modified poly(L-glutamic acid). sition of the azo chromophore in traps configuration. This couplet of bands can be associated with dipole-dipole interactions between azo side chains within the a-helix structure. Irradiation, and the consequent traps -> cis photoisomerization, completely cancels the side chain CD bands in the region of 350 nm, but does not modify at all the CD spectra in the peptide region. This indicates that, in these solvents, light produces the isomerization of the azo side chains, but the isomerization does not induce any variation of the polypeptide main chain [9,17]. The same finding has been reported by Sisido et al. for polypeptides containing p-phenylazo-phenylalanine [18]. The behaviour is quite different in water solution, at critical pH values [17,19]. Below pH 5, poly(L-glutamic acid) containing about 30 mol% azobenzene units adopts a structure which is not affected by light. Above pH 7, the polypeptide is random coil and the conformation is not affected, again, by the photoisomerization of the azo side chains. However, at pH values in the range of 5-7 (close to the pK of the conformational transition), irradiation causes a remarkable decrease of the ordered structure which is completely reversed in the dark [17,19]. The mechanism of the photoresponse was explained as follows. The primary event is the traps cis photoisomerization of the azo side chains; however, the simple geometry variation of the azo units does not seem to be sufficient to induce appreciable conformational changes of the -10F _20f -30f 210 - - 230 nm 250 350 450 i, nm 160 40 20 +20 -40 Fig. 3.

The driving force of photoregulation is likely to result from the variation of the pKa for the ionization of the unmodified COOH groups, which was found to be lower when the neighbouring azobenzene groups are in the polar cis configuration, than when azo groups are in the hydrophobic traps configuration. As a consequence, the traps -+ cis isomerization produces a higher ionization degree of the COOH side chains, thus amplifying the first light effect and causing the unfolding of the polypeptide. An analogous behaviour has been observed by Kinoshita et al. in poly(L-glutamic acid) containing about 10 mol% azobenzenesulphonate units [20]. o. Pieroni et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 185-199 2.3. Photomodulation of molecular structure in micellar phase Cationic surfactants are known to affect the conformation of poly(L-glutamic acid). This suggested that it might be possible to combine the isomerization of the photochromic side chains with the surfactant effect to obtain an amplification of the photoresponse. The expectation was actually realized by irradiating azo-modified poly(L-glutamic acid) in the presence of dodecyl ammonium chloride (DAC) at the critical micelle concentration (c.m.c.) [21]. Fig. 4 shows the CD spectra of 20% azo-modified poly(Glu) both in the absence and in the presence of DAC. In the absence of detergent at pH 7, the polymer is completely random coil and not at all affected by irradiation. In the presence of DAC below the c.m.c., both the dark-adapted and the irradiated samples are a-helical. In the presence of detergent at the c.m.c., irradiation at 350 nm (trans -> cis isomerization) induces an evident coil --* helix transition. The variation is completely reversible when the sample is dark-adapted or irradiated at 450 nm (cis --* trans isomerization). So, in the presence of DAC micelles the polypeptide conformation can be photomodulated by exposure, alternately, to light or dark, or irradiating at two different appropriate wavelengths [21].

When azo units are in the planar, apolar, trans form, they dissolve into the hydrophobic core of the micelles, forcing the polypeptide chains to assume a coil conformation. Isomerization of the azo units to the skewed, polar, cis form inhibits hydrophobic interactions and causes the azo units to get out of the micelles, thus allowing the polypeptide chains to adopt the a-helix structure which is favoured in the absence of micelles. In other words, the primary photochemical event is the trans -+ cis isomerization of the azobenzene units, but the driving force of the coil-helix transition should be the different location of the macromolecules relative to the micelles. An interesting and analogous photoresponse effect has been reported for a partially esterified poly(L-glutamate) containing 13 mol% azobenzene units in the side chains [22]. The polypeptide was incorporated into the bilayer membrane of vesicles composed of distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride. UV light irradiation of the vesicles, and the consequent trans --)- cis isomerization of the azo units, caused a transfer of the polypeptide molecule from the hydrophobic interior to the hydrophillic surface of the bilayer membrane. It is interesting to note that also some biological photoreceptors, such as photopigments of frog retinal membranes, change their location towards the water surface or the hydrocarbon core of the membrane, depending on whether the photopigment is irradiated or kept in the dark, respectively [23]. In this aspect, the described systems can be really considered synthetic models of the biological photoreceptors. A new kind of photoinduced conformational change was observed for poly(L-lysine) containing 43 mol% azobenzene groups (Scheme 3) in hexafluoro-propanol/water/sodium dodecyl sulphate [24]. In this solvent mixture, the darkadapted sample (all trans azo groups) shows in the peptide region a CD spectrum which can be attributed to the presence of a ,B-form.

Upon irradiation at 450 run, the spectrum returns to the original one. The photoinduced helix conformational change is completely reversible and the two structures can be obtained by irradiating alternately at 340 and 450 nm [24]. The photoinduced -',- helix change can be well explained on the basis of the different geometry and the different hydrophobicity of the traps and the cis azobenzene units. The -form, in fact, is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions among the side chains. So this structure is favoured when the azobenzene units have the traps configuration, characterized by planar geometry and high hydrophobicity. These interactions are inhibited when the azo units are isomerized to the skewed cis configuration, so the P-structure is destabilized and destroyed. The polypeptide chains then adopt the a-helix form, in the helixsupporting solvent hexafluoro-2-propanol. 2.4. Photostimulated `aggregation-disaggregation' processes and photocontrol of solubility Azo-modified polymers of L-glutamic acid (Scheme 2) undergo aggregation phenomena on aging in Twater solution, as indicated by the variation of light scattering intensity and CD spectra during the time (Fig. 6) [25,26]. The time dependence of CD spectra is characterized by the gradual appearance of an intense CD couplet due to the interactions of the azo side -24 \\ /2 v 3 4 340 1 ~400 a 1 i i i i L L 280 200 230 n m -~ 16 8 0 _8 -16 I-24 Fig. 6.

Pieroni et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 185-199 chains, together with a progressive distortion of the a-helix pattern. Such distortions are typical of those produced by light-scattering effects, as a result of formation of aggregates among helical polypeptide chains. Irradiation at 360 nm at any aging time, completely cancels the side chain CD bands; at the same time in the peptide region CD spectra revert to the original not distorted one, thus indicating that irradiation causes dissociation of the aggregates. The spectra revert again to the distorted ones by irradiating at 450 nm or by dark adaptation, thus confirming the reversibility of the light-induced effect. For poly(L-glutamic acid) having a high content of azobenzene side chains (more than 80%), irradiation causes reversible variations of polymer solubility [26,27]. In hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFP), the polypeptide stored in the dark assumes the a-helix structure. Addition of a small amount of water (15% vol) to the HFP solution causes formation of aggregates followed by precipitation of the polymer as a yellow material. The precipitation is total and quantitative, as it can be seen by recording the absorption spectrum of the filtered colourless solvent. Irradiation of the suspension for a few seconds at 350 nm causes the complete dissolution of the polymer, while irradiation at 450 nm or dark adaptation of the solution, gives the polymer precipitation. In HFP/water 85:15 solvent mixture, therefore, the `precipitationdissolution' cycles can be controlled by irradiation and dark adaptation, or by irradiating at two different wavelengths: 350 nm Precipitation -T=~l Dissolution 450 nm In order to investigate the dependence of the polymer solubility on the cis/traps composition of azobenzene side chains, irradiation experiments were carried out at various wavelengths of the incident light [26]. The considerable amount of photodissolved polymer was quantitatively determined by evaporating the solutions obtained upon irradiation, and weighing the dry residue. 191 44 trans 80 40 0 4 U 0 4I0 80 %cis Fig. 7. Poly(L-glutamic acid) containing 85 mol% azobenzene units. Variation of the solubility in HFP/water 85: 15 as a function of the cis/traps ratio of the azo side chains. The results are illustrated in Fig. 7. The solubility of the polymer, as a function of the cis/traps ratio of azobenzene side chains, is described by a sharp sigmoidal curve. The polymer is fully insoluble when more than 60% azo groups are in trans configuration. By contrast, the maximum amount of photosolubilization is achieved when 60% azo groups are in cis configuration. The midpoint of the transition is in correspondence of 50/50 trans/cis isomeric composition. The observed photosolubility effect could in principle be explained considering the higher polar character of the cis form with respect to the trans form of the azo groups. Actually, in azobenzene, the dipole moment was reported to be 3.0-3.1 D for the cis isomer, and 0.0-0.5 D for the trans isomer [28]. However, if the higher polarity of the cis isomer were the decisive factor which causes the dissolution, the polymer solubility should gradually increase with increasing the cis content. Moreover, the phenomenon is not observed in low molecular weight compounds. The photosolubility effect can be well interpreted on the basis of association among macromolecules, through hydrophobic interactions and stacking of azobenzene side chains. When azobenzene moieties are in the planar traps configuration, hydrophobic interac- 192 O. Pieroni et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 185-199 tions and stacking between the azo groups are favoured, so aggregation and precipitation occur. When the azo moieties are photoisomerized to the skewed cis configuration, interactions and stacking between azo groups are inhibited, so disaggregation of the macromolecules takes place, and polymer dissolution occurs. Photostimulated polymer precipitation and dissolution has suggested its possible application in photoresist technology [29,30]. The experimental finding may also be relevant to the molecular mechanisms responsible for photoregulated biological processes. Indeed, naturally occurring photoreceptors usually consist of photochromic molecules attached to protein matrices: the photoexcitation of the photochromic molecules induces variations in the structure and the state of assembly of the macromolecular matrix. It is interesting to compare here the above-described photostimulated aggregation changes and the reversible variations of solubility observed in photochromic synthetic polypeptides, with the photobehaviour of phytochrome. This photochromic protein exists in two forms, Pr (red-absorbing phytochrome) and Pfr (far-red-absorbing phytochrome), which are interconvertible by light. In the unirradiated tissue, phytochrome present as inactive Pr form is uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the pigment is soluble upon extraction in aqueous buffers. Photoconversion to the active Pfr form (irradiation at 660 nm) leads to a rapid association of the previously soluble pigment and formation of a pelletable material localized on the membrane. Reconversion to Pr (irradiation at 730 nm) results in a relatively slow disaggregation and resolubilization of the molecules [31,32]. 2.5. Photoresponse in monolayer and LB systems Poly(L-lysine) containing 43 mol% azobenzene units (Scheme 3) has been reported to form a stable monolayer at the water/air interface [33]. When the polypeptide monolayer is kept at constant area, irradiation with 365 and 450 ran light, alternately, produces reversible z 10 5 o- 0 - RZ+ Ai + Az + A,1 4A2' 20 40 Time, min 60 80 Fig. 8.

The monolayer was first compressed to 7 mN/m, then illuminated alternately with 365 nm (.h) and 450 nm (xz) radiation. changes (about 25%) of the surface pressure of the monolayer (Fig. 8). At constant pressure, the observed changes are converted into reversible changes of the surface area of the monolayer. IR spectra of specimens prepared from monolayers using the folding frame described by Malcolm [34] are typical of oriented a-helices with parallel dichroism of the amide A (3300 cm-1) and amide 1 (1652 cm-1) bands, and perpendicular dichroism in the amide II band (1545 cm-1). The result was independent of whether the specimen was prepared from monolayer illuminated with 450 nm light (azo units in trans configuration) or with 365-run irradiation (azo units in cis configuration). This evidence suggests that in the monolayer state the polymer does not undergo a conformational change on irradiation. The photomechanical effects seem to be simply due to the trans -+ cis isomerization of the azobenzene groups which occupy a larger area in the interface when they are in the trans configuration than in the cis configuration. Moreover, the cis form is significantly more polar than the trans form and will therefore be more attracted to the water subface. A detailed investigation of LangmuirBlodgett films of photochromic polypeptides has been carried out by Menzel et al. [35-37], who obtained LB films from poly(L-glutamates bearing azobenzene moieties in the side chains coupled to the main chain with spacers of different O. Pieroni et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 185-199 length. The polymers have a so-called `hairy rod' structure, that is a stiff polymer backbone with flexible side chains. The structure of the LB films is built up by macromolecules arranged in layers with the main chains preferentially oriented in the dipping direction; the azo side chains are preferentially oriented normal to the surface of the substrate with a non-symmetric distribution of the side chains around the backbone. On isomerization of the azobenzene moieties by irradiation at 360 nm, the molecular arrangement changes dramatically. The preferred orientation of the main chain is retained, but the layered structure is lost, as a result of a rearrangement of the hairy rods to a more symmetrical distribution of the side chains around the main chain. The authors have also described LB films obtained from copoly(L-glutamates bearing azobenzene (16 mol%) and long alkyl side chains (84 mol%) [36]. The trans -- cis photoisomerization of the azo units in the LB films was found to proceed to a high extent, but no significant variation was observed in the supramolecular structure as well as in the optical properties. 3. Poly(a-amino acid)s containing spiropyran units in the side chains 3.1. Photochromic behaviour As mentioned in the Introduction (Fig. 1), photochromism of spiropyrans involves photoisomers characterized by large differences in geometry and polarity, therefore their interconversion is expected to cause large structural changes in the attached macromolecules. In addition, while generation of cis and trans isomers of azobenzene requires artificial source of UV light, spiropyran systems have the advantage to respond to sunlight. Poly(a-amino acid)s containing spiropyran units in the side chains have been obtained by reacting poly(L-glutamic acid) and poly(L-lysine) with spiropyran reagents [38-43]. All the modified polymers, having various contents of photochromic units (Schemes 4 and 5) resulted solu- 193 CH&N' 3 - - \\ / NOp (Z)2 i o CO COOH (Z)2 (Z)2 AV-NH-CH-CO-MNH-CH-CO-Nr Scheme 4.

At room temperature in the dark, they give coloured solutions due to the presence of the merocyanine form; irradiation with visible light or just exposure to sunlight causes the complete bleaching of the solutions due to formation of the colourless spiro form (Fig. 1). The back reaction occurs in the dark and the original colour is reversibly recovered. The reverse photochromism is likely to be due to the very polar solvent HFP which stabilizes the charged merocyanine form more than the apolar spiro form. Fig. 9 shows the effect of light on the absorption spectra of poly(L-glutamate) containing 85 mol% photochromic units in the side chains (Scheme 4). The coloured solution kept in the dark exhibits two intense bands at 500 and 370 nm, corresponding to the merocyanine species.

As a confirmation, the dark-adapted HFP solutions of the polypeptide are characterized by high values of viscosity, typical of those displayed by polyelectrolytes. The viscosity dramatically decreases upon exposure to sunlight and returns to the original value in the dark [40]. 3.3. Photomodulation of molecular structure by combined action of light and solvent We now want to describe experiments showing that the photoinduced structural modifications can be activated or inhibited by changing the acidity/basicity properties of the medium or by adding cosolvents, so that the photoresponse effect can be actually modulated by combined action of light and environment. 3.3.1. Poly (spiropyran-L-glutamate) in acid conditions When spiropyrans are treated with acids they are converted into spiropyran salts which exhibit the photochromic behaviour illustrated in Fig. 11. The acid protonates the phenoxy group of the merocyanine II. The open form III is converted by light into the N-protonated spiro structure IV This last is a very weak base, so it can lose a proton and give the neutral spiro structure I [46].

Continuous line, dark adapted; dashed line, irradiated samples. which converted spiropyran units into the corresponding spiropyran salts [40]. In the presence of acid the polypeptide did not give light-induced conformational changes and the macromolecules were random coils either when the sample was kept in the dark or when it was exposed to light. However, when appropriate amounts of methanol were added as a cosolvent, the system responded to light giving random coil ahelix transitions, the extent of the photoresponse depending on the methanol concentration. The effect of light on CD spectra at various solvent compositions is shown in Fig. 12. In pure HFP or when methanol is below 5%, both the dark-adapted and the irradiated samples show the typical CD pattern of disordered polypeptides. In HFP/MeOH 90:10, the sample kept in the dark is random coil, whereas the sample exposed to light displays the standard CD pattern of the a-helix. The intensity of the bands indicates that in these conditions light causes the full conversion from random coil to 100% a-helix. On increasing methanol concentration, also the dark-adapted sample becomes partially helical and, finally, when methanol is higher than 40%, both the samples are fully helical. The conformational behaviour was explained as follows [40]. When methanol concentration 196 O. Pieroni et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 185-199 is below 5% the photochromic side chains are present as charge species either in the dark (Oprotonated merocyanine III) or in the light (Nprotonated spiro form IV) (Fig. 11); in both cases, the repulsive forces among the side chains make the macromolecules to adopt an extended coil conformation and no photoresponse is observed. Addition of methanol should shift the equilibrium between the two colourless species IV and I towards the neutral spiro form I: in these conditions, the photochromic side chains are present as charges species in the dark and as neutral species in the light, so the foldingunfolding of the macromolecules is photocontrolled by the isomerization of the side chains. At high methanol concentration (>40%), the behaviour may be similar to that observed for other poly(a-amino acid)s with ionic side chains such as poly(L-lysine hydrochloride) which is random coil in water but becomes helical upon addition of a methanol excess [47], so the macromolecules are helical both in dark and light conditions. 3.3.2. Poly (spiropyran-L-lysine): influence of triethylamine on photoresponsiveness Contrary to the spiropyran-modified polymers of L-glutamic acid, the analogous polymers of L-lysine (Scheme 5) do not give light-induced conformational changes in pure HFP, and they are always random coil, either when the samples are kept in the dark or when they are exposed to light [39]. The different conformational behaviour of spiropyran-modified poly(L-lysine) with respect to spiropyran-containing poly(Lglutamate) is likely to be due to the unmodified lysine side chains which are probably protonated by the acid solvent HFP [48]. As a result, the polypeptide is essentially a polycation and the macromolecules adopt an extended coil conformation which is not affected by the photoisomerization of the photochromic units. Addition of triethylamine to the HFP solutions does not produce significant variations of the absorption spectra, thus excluding variations of the isomeric composition. By contrast, CD measurements reveal that triethylamine ad- , -5 m x `- -10 -15 0 5 10 15 9b NEt3 Fig. 13. Poly(L-lysine) containing 46 mol% spiropyran units, in HFP/NEt3. Variation of ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of triethylamine concentration for the sample kept in the dark (continuous line) and the irradiated one (dashed line). dition induces coil -+ helix conformational transitions of the macromolecular chains (Fig. 13). The most remarkable aspect is that two separate curves are observed for the sample kept in the dark and for the irradiated one, respectively. More specifically, in the case of 46% modified poly(L-lysine), the amount of base needed to induce the transition is 3-10% for the sample kept in the dark, and about 10-15% for the sample exposed to light (Fig. 13). Therefore, at any triethylamine concentration in the range between the two curves, exposure to light and dark conditions produces reversible variations of helix content. Fig. 14 shows the effect of light on CD spectra at various triethylamine concentrations. It clearly appears that combination of photochromic effects with appropriate triethylamine amounts allows regulation of extent of the photoresponse. A possible effect of triethylamine is the removal of protons from the unmodified amino side chains. In these conditions the polypeptide conformation can be controlled by the isomerization of the photochromic groups, as observed for poly(spiropyran-L-glutamate): in the dark, the photochromic side chains are present as charged merocyanine form, so the macromolecules are random coil; exposure to light and the conse- m a) o) c) a) e) 1) i ,y , 1 V, 1 1 , _ 1 1 ; 1 1 1 1 1 I ; I 1 L I V I 1 1 I 1 i 1 - I 1 I II 1 I 1 s 1 1 200 240 200 240 200 240 200 240 200 240 200 240 A, nm Fig. 14.

Continuous line, dark adapted; dashed line, irradiated samples. quent isomerization to the apolar spirform makes the macromolecules to adopt the a-helix conformation. Alternatively, the system might behave as other polypeptides which are random coil in pure solvents such as dimethylsulphoxide and dichloroacetic acid, but become helical in a mixed solvent. The effect was attributed to formation of a complex derivative between the solvent component [49,50]. In the present system, mixing of HFP and triethylamine is strongly exothermic and there is definite evidence for formation of a HFP/NEt3 saline complex [51], just as occurring for DMSO/dichloroacetic acid. The HFP/NEt3 saline complex might exert a shielding effect between the charged side chains, thus allowing the macromolecules to stay in ahelix even with charged side chains. The concentration of saline complex, and therefore the amount of triethylamine needed to allow the ahelix conformation should be different for the dark-adapted sample (NH3 groups surrounded by merocyanine moieties) and for the irradiated one (NH3 groups surrounded by spiro moieties), thus explaining the occurrence of two separate transition curves (Fig. 13). Experimental data clearly show that the photoisomerization of the side chains is able to trigger the coil ~ helix transition of the polypeptide chains only in a very narrow `window' of NEt3 concentration. The system, therefore, can O. Pieroni et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 185-199 197 be considered to be an example of photochromic system having `gated response' [52]. 4. Conclusions Incorporation of organic photochromic molecules in polymer matrices allows the combination of their intrinsic photochemical properties with the typical polymer properties such as processability and stability, thus improving properties of the photoactive material. Moreover, the photoisomerization of photochromes embedded in macromolecular matrices is accompanied not only by variations of the absorption spectra, but can also induce modifications of other physical and chemical properties of the material, thus offering wider possible applications of photochromic compounds. More specifically, when photochromic molecules are attached to ordered chiral macromolecules such as poly(a-amino acid)s, the photochromic reactions can produce large and reversible changes of optical rotatory power. Such systems have been proposed as `chiroptical molecular switches' for optical recording, in which a record written by irradiation should be read by monitoring the optical rotation instead of the absorbance. This procedure should avoid erasure of the record by the read-out process [5,53]. Here we should point out that the observation of photoinduced variations of optical activity (optical rotatory power and CD bands) does not necessarily mean the occurrence of photoinduced structural variations of the macromolecules. We have seen, for instance, that azomodified poly(L-glutamic acid) show in TMP the a-helix CD pattern below 250 nm, and an intense CD couplet at about 350 nm due to the side chain contribution. Irradiation completely cancels the side chain CD bands, but does not at all modify the CD spectrum in the peptide region and therefore does not induce any variation in the backbone structure. In specific conditions, the photoisomerization of the photochromic units induces reversible order-disorder variations, allowing photomodu- 198 O. Pieroni et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 185-199 lation of the macromolecular structure. Findings indicate that light induced structural changes usually occurs when the system is in a labile folded structure: this has been achieved by irradiating close to conformational transitions, in solvent mixtures having critical composition, in micellar phase. The most exciting structural variations have been observed in poly(a-amino acid)s containing spiropyran units, in which exposure to sunlight for a few seconds induces the reversible transition from random coil to 100% a-helix. A remarkable aspect of some photochromic compounds is the so-called `gated response', which means that the system is able to respond to light only when an external stimulus is applied [5,52]. Poly(a-amino acid)s modified with spiropyran units provide an example of photochromic systems characterized by such gated response: in fact, the photoresponse effect was found to be activated or inhibited by acid/base conditions, and photomodulation of the macromolecular structure was actually achieved in a narrow range of solvent composition. Besides the examples reviewed in this paper, photochromic molecules have been reacted with other compounds having amino acidic chemical composition, including other poly(a-amino acid)s [54,55], a poly(pentapeptide) model of elastin [56] and several proteins [57-63]. In the latter case, photoinduced variations of biological functions have been found to occur as a result of photoinduced structural changes. We conclude that poly(a-amino acid)s bearing photochromic units are quite special photoresponsive materials in which the primary photochemical event occurring in the photochromic units is amplified and transduced by the structural variations of the macromolecules. They may be relevant to the mechanisms of photoregulated biological processes and can find application in photomodulable devices. References [1] G.H. Brown.

Photochromic polymers are able to respond to light giving reversible variations of their structure and conformation which, in turn, are accompanied by variations of their physical and chemical properties. This paper describes the photochromic behaviour of poly(\u03b1-amino acid)s containing azobenzene and spiropyran groups in the side chains, and illustrates the most significative examples of their photoresponse effects. Experimental findings provide evidence that the molecular and supramolecular structure of these polypeptides can be photomodulated using the photosensitive side chains as effectors. The extent and the kind of photoresponse, including photoinduced coil \u21cc \u03b1-helix transitions, photostimulated aggregation/disaggregation processes, reversible variations of viscosity and solubility, were found to depend on polymer and environment conditions. Interpretative models of the photoresponse effects indicate that photochromic poly(\u03b1-amino acid) systems actually behave as amplifiers and transducers of the primary photochemical event occurring in the side chains, and therefore may be promising materials for application in optical technology.
