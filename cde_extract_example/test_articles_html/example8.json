These hyperbranched polymers are characterized by very high solubilities and unusually low solution viscosities when compared to linear analogs. This is a result of their globular shape and lack of crystallinity. The preparation and selected properties of two types of hyperbranched polymers, polyphenylene and polyesters, is discussed.

Introduction The search for reactive polymers used as reagents [1], protecting groups [2,3] or catalysts [4,5] in organic synthesis has traditionally focused on linear or crosslinked materials carrying a variety of functional groups. The most frequently used reactive polymer is a polystyrene resin crosslinked with 1 or 2% divinylbenzene that has been partially chloromethylated. This resin was at the core of the concept of solidphase synthesis first described in Merrifield's seminal work [6] on the solid-phase synthesis of polypeptides in 1963. This chloromethylated polystyrene resin has been modified in countless ways [7] to afford a variety of reactive polymers * Corresponding author. 1381-5148/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved. SSDI1381-5148(95)00010-0 for use in solid-phase processes that take advantage of the insolubility of the polymers to facilitate their isolation and recycling [3]. Linear polymers containing multiple reactive groups [4,5,8] have also been used in similar applications although their solubility is frequently impaired once their reactive groups have reacted partially. This report concerns a new class of threedimensional polymers termed `hyperbranched' that exhibit unusually high solubilities and that contain large numbers of reactive groups located both at multiple chain-ends and throughout the macromolecule. 2. The origins of hyperbranched polymers The term `hyperbranched'was only coined recently by Kim and Webster [9] to describe highly 128 A B J.MJ Frhet, CJ.

Flory's `randomly branched molecules' by polycondensation of ABZ monomers. branched polymers such as the polyphenylenes that are obtained in one step by the polymerization of 3,5-dibromobenzene boronic acid via a Suzuki reaction [10] without isolation of any intermediates. The fundamental concepts underlying the preparation of hyperbranched polymers were considered by Flory [11] more than fifty years ago, and indeed, they are included in his classic Baker Lectures text [12] . Flory predicted that AB, monomers containing one reactive group of one type (A) and x reactive groups of another type (B, with x >2) would polymerize readily to afford highly branched three-dimensional structures free of crosslinks (Fig. 1). Examples of such polymerizations were seldom encountered in the literature perhaps due to the complexities of the systems or the incorrect assumption that the highly branched products obtained by polymerization of AB, monomers would be intractable. Thus, the insoluble hydrocarbon obtained by Friedel and Crafts [13] by reaction of benzyl chloride with aluminum trichloride [14], and the phenol derivative known as Lautemann's red [15] would both be recognized today as hyperbranched polymers. Several conditions have to be met in order to obtain high molecular weight hyperbranched polymers from an ABZ monomer. First, reactive groups A and B should only react with each other in the presence of a catalyst, or after a suitable activation step has been carried out (e.g. the removal of a protecting group via a chemical, thermal, or photochemical process). The mutual re- activity of groups A and B, following their activation or introduction of the catalyst, should be high to facilitate polymer formation. Sidereactions should be avoided to prevent deactivation of the growing polymer. In particular, it is important that the single reactive group A which is found only once in each growing chain, not be lost to a side reaction during polymerization, lest the growth process be irreversibly disturbed. Another type of polymer that also possess a highly branched three-dimensional structure is the family of dendritic macromolecules such as Tomalia's Starburst\" dendrimers [16,17] or the well-known polyethers [18-20] obtained by `convergent' growth. These and other analogous dendrimers are essentially monodisperse macromolecules with highly regular structures because they are prepared in multi-step repetitive syntheses with intermediate purifications performed at each step of the growth. In contrast, almost all hyperbranched polymers known today are obtained in a single step by condensation processes that, as will be seen below, lead to polydisperse and irregular but highly branched structures. Growth of a hyperbranched polymer from an ABZ monomer could, in principle, lead to regular dendritic molecules with two branches developing in regular fashion from each monomer unit. However this type of perfect branching is never encountered for hyperbranched structures grown by step-growth polymerizations in one-pot reactions. During the growth process, the two B reactive groups of a terminal unit have, in principle, the same reactivity. However, their ability to react is clearly controlled by kinetic factors because access to one of the two reactive sites of a given unit may well be hindered, especially after the other site has reacted thereby increasing the steric constraints in the immediate vicinity of the remaining unreacted B group. Regular dendritic growth is further impeded by the fact that monomer is depleted early on during the polycondensation process and subsequent growth only occurs via coupling of more sterically hindered oligomeric units. A less simplistic and more detailed consideration of the kinetic J.MJ Frhet, CJ. Hawker/ Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 127-136 and thermodynamic factors that affect growth of all but the most flexible and conformationally mobile ABZ monomer units reveals that perfect branching cannot realistically be expected for hyperbranched polymers. As a result of incomplete reaction of all of the B groups of the monomer units that are incorporated within polymer chains, it is useful to define the `degree of branching' (DB) of a hyperbranched polymer. This degree of branching reflects the mole fraction of the fully branched monomers that are found either within the polymer chain or at the chain-ends. Therefore a perfectly branched dendrimer would have a degree of branching of one, while a linear polymer would have a degree of branching of zero. In practice, the degree of branching of a hyperbranched polymer of a given degree of polymerization (DP) can be measured if the mole fraction f of monomer units that have reacted through only one of their two B groups can be determined since DB = (1 - f ). 3. Hyperbranched polyphenylenes Notwithstanding the work of Friedel and Crafts who did not produce hyperbranched polymers by design, the modern era of hyperbranched polymers can be traced to the startling results obtained by Kim and Webster [9] who reported the preparation of highly branched soluble polyphenylene. As mentioned earlier, this hyperbranched polymer was prepared by the palladium catalyzed self-condensation of 3,5dibromobenzene boronic acid, therefore, the aromatic rings of the polyphenylene are linked through positions 1, 3, and 5. The hyperbranched polyphenylenes are remarkable because of their solubility in common organic solvents such as THF, quite unlike their linear analogs that are mostly insoluble even at modest values of DP. Although exact molecular weight measurements were not performed, gel permeation chromatography data indicates that polyphenylenes containing from 50 to perhaps more than 100 aromatic rings were obtained [21]. 129 Another characteristic of these polymers is their high bromine content because unreacted aryl bromide functionalities remain, not only at the numerous chain-ends of the polymer, but also at unreacted sites located throughout the macromolecule. These remaining functionalities can be used effectively to transform the hyperbranched polyphenylene into a water-soluble moiety that contains a large number of carboxylate groups throughout the hyperbranched structure as well as at its chain-ends. The transformation is carried out [21] using a standard lithiation-carbonation procedure [22]; several other transformations of the lithiated hyperbranched polyphenylene have also been performed to prepare other soluble reactive polymers or star polymers [9,21]. 4.

Schematic representation of a hyperbranched aromatic polyester. O O RO~ \\OR acid (1) or 5-hydroxy-l,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid (2) have led to significant activity in the preparation of hyperbranched aromatic polyesters. Our interest in the preparation of hyperbranched polymers containing numerous reactive phenolic functionalities led us to consider 3,5-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)benzoyl chloride (3) as the monomer rather than more classical 3,5diacetoxybenzoic acid (4) because it was expected that the trimethylsilyl groups located at the chain ends of the polymer could be removed easily without risking the degradation of the labile polyester linkages [23]. The procedure we selected was adapted from a method used by Kricheldorf et al. for the preparation of linear or slightly branched polyesters by polycondensation of trimethylsilyloxy-benzoyl chloride [24]. The monomer itself is best obtained [25] by reaction of 1 with excess hexamethyldisilazane to afford the fully trimethylsilyl-protected moiety, followed by reaction with thionyl chloride in the presence of dimethyl formamide to give the desired substituted benzoyl chloride 3. Polymerization of monomer 3 to polyester 5a occurs readily by heating to elevated temperatures (150-275, depending on reaction conditions) in the presence of catalytic amounts of chloride ion or DMF (Fig. 3). Polymers with weight average molecular weights between a few thousands and several hundred thousand Daltons or J.M.J Frhet, CJ. Hawker/ Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 127-136 more may be obtained by controlling the concentration of the catalyst as well as the reaction time and temperature. Because the polymerization proceeds with concomitant release of trimethylchlorosilane, highest molecular weights are obtained for reactions done under high vacuum. A solvent such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene or phenylsulfone may be used to help alleviate the problem of high viscosity during polymerization. It must be emphasized that the purity of monomer 3 is very important to achieve control of the polymerization process, because monomer contaminated with chloride ion polymerizes in somewhat uncontrolled fashion upon heating. In contrast, the pure monomer is perfectly stable even at elevated temperatures (e.g. 200) until a catalyst such as chloride ion or DMF is added [25]. The degree of branching of the hyperbranched polyesters obtained by this process is close to 60% as measured by NMR spectrometry. Both 'H-NMR and '3C-NMR spectrometry allow the direct measurement of resonances that can be attributed unambiguously to the branched, terminal, or linear monomer units. Measuring the molecular weight of dendritic or hyperbranched polymers requires special care because the usual technique of sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC) calibrated with linear standards such as narrow polydispersity polystyrene cannot provide absolute values. Our early work with highly regular dendritic polyethers has demonstrated that once a threshold molecular weight is passed, SEC measurements consistently underestimate the molecular weight of globular polymers [18]. For this reason, the molecular weight of hyperbranched polymers must be measured using an absolute technique such as low angle laser light scattering (LALLS) or multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS). Recent characterization work by Mourey and colleagues, using several families of hyperbranched polyesters [26,27], has demonstrated that the molecular weights measured by LALLS agree with those obtained by universal 131 0 R\"0 0 OH hy OT. 0 n TBDMS-N(MeICOCF3 5b DMAP DCC ROCO(CHZt,COOH 0 n 0 0 OR _ O O~ n n Fig. 4. Derivatization of hyperbranched polyester 5b. calibration using coupled differential viscometry. The latter technique is easier to use than LALLS and has the advantage of better sensitivity over the broad molecular weight distributions that are characteristic of these hyperbranched polyesters. It must be emphasized, however, that universal calibration does not apply to regular dendritic macromolecules whose viscosity behavior is quite different from that of all other known polymers [28]. As expected, the trimethylsilyl groups can be removed completely under very mild conditions to afford a hyperbranched polymer 5b containing a large number of free phenolic groups. Complete conversion of the reactive phenolic groups of 5b to other functionalities may be achieved under mild conditions with a variety of reagents as shown in Fig. 4. It is interesting to consider that these transformations affect not only the chain-ends, but also other groups interspersed throughout the macromolecule. Aside from the chain-ends, these functionalities are the B groups of the ABZ monomer units that were unable to react during the polycondensation reaction due to limited kinetic accessibility. Under the more favorable thermodynamic conditions that are used for the chemical modification process, 132 J.MJ Frechet, CJ. Hawker/Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 127-136 reaction occurs at all sites, although extended reaction times must sometimes be used. An alternate route to the same types of polyesters was described recently by Turner et al. [26]. The monomer selected for their more conventional, and perhaps ultimately more practical, synthesis was 3,5-diacetoxybenzoic acid (4). Although the synthesis using the trimethylsilylated monomer 3 is more easily controlled [25] over a broad range of temperatures, the approach involving the diacetoxy monomer 4 is advantageous as it matches current technology used for the commercial production of polyesters. The polymerization of 4 to hyperbranched polyester 5c generally requires a higher temperature than was the case for the preparation of 5a because the polymerization of 4 is very slow at or below 170. The molecular weights of the polymers that are obtained can be extremely high. For example, a bulk polymerization done in the melt at 250 afforded a hyperbranched polyester with a weight average molecular weight exceeding 1 million. It is remarkable that such a high molecular weight fully aromatic polyester should be soluble in common organic solvents such as THE Even more remarkable is the extremely low intrinsic viscosity of this polymer [ri] = 0.34 dl/g. One drawback of using 4 rather than 3 as the monomer in the preparation of hyperbranched polyesters is that the acetyl groups that are found at chain-ends and throughout the branched structure of polyester 5c must be removed to obtain the reactive hyperbranched polymer 5b. Turner et al. [26] were able to remove these acetyl groups using mild acid hydrolysis to obtain 5b, but the hydrolysis process must be carefully controlled to avoid precipitation of the polymer or degradation of its backbone. Unfortunately the stability of these polyesters under basic conditions is low because phenolate is such a good leaving group. The degree of branching for both polyesters 5a and 5c was close to 0.5-0.6 regardless of the method of preparation confirming that steric and kinetic factors are determinant during the growth process. 4.2. Monomers derived from the isophthalic acid family The direct polymerization of 5-hydroxy-1,3benzenedicarboxylic acid (2) is not possible because the monomer decomposes before melting. Its 5-acetoxy derivative (6) polymerizes [27] readily to afford another hyperbranched polyester (7a) containing multiple carboxylic acid groups at chain-ends and throughout the macromolecule (Fig. 5). The polymerization of 6 is more difficult to carry out than that of 4 and lower molecular weight polymers are obtained. Polymerization is best achieved using a twostage process involving both heating to 250 and operating under high vacuum to remove the acetic acid that is released during polymerization. The polymerization can also be performed at lower temperature using an inert diluent such as phenylsulfone. Of particular concern in this polymerization is the fact that formation of anhydride linkages occurs to an extent that is sufficient to insolubilize the final polyester.

Hawker/Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 127-136 anhydride linkages can be removed by treatment of the crosslinked polyester with wet THF, their formation is, nevertheless, a problem because an additional step is required for the preparation of the desired soluble carboxyl-functionalized polyester. Although the multiple carboxylic acid functionalities of polyester 7a are interesting because of their high chemical reactivity, they also make analysis of the polymers by standard size exclusion techniques very difficult. The carboxylic acid-terminated hyperbranched polyesters are strongly absorbed onto standard SEC columns and their analysis requires prior derivatization by silylation. As was the case for the hydroxylterminated polyester 5b, derivatization by reaction with diazomethane is complicated by significant degradation of the polyester. The culprit is again the labile phenyl ester linkage that may be cleaved during treatment with the basic diazomethane reagent. Broad molecular weight distributions are obtained as was the case for most polymerizations leading to polyester 5c. Treatment of polymer 7a with aqueous base is expected to afford the corresponding watersoluble polyester salt 7b (Fig. 5). However, this reaction is made difficult by the very high tendency of the polymer to degrade even under buffered alkaline conditions. It is possible to isolate the carboxylate polymer 7b using very special conditions that result in its precipitation as soon as it is formed. However, this lack of stability is detrimental to possible applications that would benefit from both its water-solubility and its globular shape that is reminiscent of classical micellar structures. This alkaline lability, inherent to the aromatic polyester structure, is unfortunate because the somewhat analogous carboxylated polyphenylenes of Kim and Webster [27] are too difficult to prepare on a scale sufficient to allow their study and use. Kricheldorf and Ster [29] have also reported the synthesis of hyperbranched polyester 7c (Fig. 5) by polymerization of bis(trimethylsilyl) 5-acetoxy-1,3-benzenedicarboxylate (8). This polymerization is advantageous when com- 133 pared to that of 6 because a soluble product is obtained without the complication due to anhydride formation and crosslinking. In addition, the product that is obtained can be analyzed directly by size exclusion chromatography since it does not have the free carboxylic acid groups that cause serious problems during GPC measurements. 5. Hyperbranched aliphatic polyesters Hyperbranched polyesters based on fully or partly aliphatic monomers have also been prepared. Kambouris and Hawker [30] prepared a polyester with a degree of branching of 0.5 by the thermal polycondensation of methyl 4,4-bis(4'hydroxyphenyl)pentanoate (9), in the presence of 5% of cobalt acetate. This interesting hyperbranched polyester also has a large number of reactive phenolic groups that can be functionalized readily as was the case for 5b. Unfortunately, since the starting material used in this synthesis is a phenol rather than an aliphatic alcohol, the polyester is also extremely labile in basic medium. In fact, its hydrolysis was key to the development of a method that can be applied to all hyperbranched polyesters for the determination of their structure and the measurement of their degree of branching [30]. Similarly, Turner et al. [27] have also prepared a partly aliphatic hyperbranched polyester by the melt polymerization of 5-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-1,3benzenedicarboxylic acid (10) in the presence of dibutyl tin diacetate as a catalyst. The polyester that is obtained has not been studied extensively, although it is anticipated that its stability in alkaline medium should be vastly superior to those of polyesters 5 and 7 because of the absence of phenolate leaving groups. Finally, wholly aliphatic hyperbranched polyesters have been reported by Hult and coworkers [31]. Unlike other previous syntheses of hyperbranched polyesters, Hult's polymers were obtained using a two-step procedure designed to cap the active hydroxyl functional groups of the hyperbranched polymers with aliphatic chains or 134 J.MJ Frhet, CJ. Hawker/Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 127-136 polymerizable allyloxy groups. The basic framework of the hyperbranched polyesters is obtained in a first step that involves the polycondensation of various ratios of 2,2-bis-(hydroxymethyl)propanoic acid and 3,3,7,7-tetra(hydroxymethyl)-5oxa-nonane in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid at 140. The oligomeric product obtained in the first step is then treated, without intermediate isolation, with dodecanoic acid at the same reaction temperature to effect the capping of the numerous hydroxyls that were obtained in the initial polycondensation step. Alternatively, the second step could be carried out using an saturated carboxylic acid, 6,6-di(allyloxymethyl)3-oxo-4-oxa-l-cis-octene-l-carboxylic acid, to afford the hyperbranched polymer with curable allyloxy end groups. Because these hyperbranched polyesters were designed to be used in curable coatings, the molecular weight of the polymers was kept low. Aliphatic building blocks were selected to ensure that the products would be liquids at room temperature. 6. Selected properties of the hyperbranched polyphenylene and polyesters In addition to their extremely high solubilities, solutions of hyperbranched polymers exhibit remarkably low viscosities. The relationship between intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight of the hyperbranched polyesters as expressed in the Mark-Houwinck-Sakurada equation, [r7] = KM', is characterized by anomalously low a values in the range 0.21-0.44. In contrast, linear, random-coil polymers have a values near 0.7 while branched polymers have a values below 0.5. The very low a values measured for the hyperbranched polymers are therefore indicative of their highly compact and branched structures. It is interesting to compare the viscosity vs molecular weight behavior of linear, hyperbranched, and dendritic polymers. Fig. 6, adapted from measurements made by Mourey et al., using polyether dendrimers [28] as well as hyperbranched polyesters and polystyrene [26,27], illustrates the differences between these J /A) Linear'Z~ i i _. -' 't.lB) Hyperbranched (C) Dendritic 3.0 5.0 Log M Fig. 6. Relationship between intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight for: (A) polystyrene; (B) hyperbranched polyester; and (C) dendritic polyether. 3 types of polymer architectures. In contrast to linear polystyrene, for which a monotonic relationship between molecular weight and viscosity is seen, the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada plot for dendrimers exhibits a bell-shape with a distinct maximum. The corresponding plot for hyperbranched polymers such as 5c or 6 is analogous to that obtained for linear polymers, except that its slope (reflecting the a value) is much lower as a result of their compact structure. The maximum observed in the bell-shape plot of [>7] vs Mr for dendrimers is uniquely related to their globular or perhaps even spherical shape. Therefore, a maximum is easily rationalized because intrinsic viscosity is expressed as a ratio of volume over mass (dl/g) and the volume of a sphere increases cubically with radius (or size of a dendrimer) while the mass of the dendrimer grows exponentially. The difference in behavior between dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers stems from the irregular growth of the latter. It must be noted, however, that it is very unlikely that a regular dendrimer with a molecular weight of 106 could be obtained by convergent or divergent growth of monomer 1 or a derivative thereof. Despite their lack of true dendritic behavior, the hyperbranched polyesters have extremely interesting rheological properties that make them attractive for a variety of applications as additives, rheology modifiers, components for reactive injection molding, etc. J.M.J. Frhet, CJ. Hawker/Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (I) 127-136 Due to their globular shapes, hyperbranched polymers may be ideally suited for blending with other commodity polymers because it is expected that their presence will contribute to a significant change in the overall rheological properties of the blends. Indeed, this expectation was proven in blend studies carried out by Kim and Webster [21] using their hyperbranched polyphenylene and polystyrene. In spite of poor mixing, the melt viscosity of a polystyrene blend containing 5% of the polyphenylene was lowered to about 50% at 180. This remarkable observation is very encouraging though much further work is needed to fully realize the potential of hyperbranched polymers as rheology modifying additives. 7. Perspective Much remains to be done before hyperbranched polymers take their place alongside commodity linear polymers in everyday applications. The characterization of the hyperbranched polymers will require special attention as the literature on this emerging family of important materials already contains what appear to be erroneous or misinterpreted claims. Characteristics such as actual molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, degree of branching, the presence of a unique reactive A group at one chain-end, the exact nature of all B chain-ends and unreacted B groups, the presence of looped structures, etc., all have an effect on both applications and ultimate properties and therefore should be determined very thoroughly. In addition, it is important that new polymerization routes be found to allow the preparation of various families of hyperbranched polymers, both aliphatic and aromatic, that may be used in combination with, or instead of linear polymers. In this regard, we have recently developed a new route to aliphatic hyperbranched polymers [32,33] that involves a vinyl polymerization process using classical `living-like' polymerization techniques with AB rather than AB., monomers. These new aliphatic hyperbranched polymers, including functionalized polystyrenes, 135 polyethers, etc., open new avenues for applications in adhesives, coatings, separation media, imaging materials, rheology modifiers and other additives, etc. 8. Conclusion Hyperbranched polymers offer an interesting alternative to the more perfect dendritic macromolecules that are generally much more difficult to prepare. Both families of polymers share properties that derive from their globular shapes. Their high solubility, low viscosity, and high chemical reactivity, due in part to the presence of numerous chain-ends, sets them apart from more classical linear of even star polymers. Hyperbranched aromatic polyesters are particularly interesting because of the ready availability of ABz monomers such as 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid or 5-hydroxy-1,3-benzenedicarboxylic acid, and also because of their structural closeness to current commodity polymers.

Hyperbranched polymers prepared by step-growth polymerization of AB x monomers carry a very large number of reactive groups at their numerous chain-ends as well as throughout the macromolecule. These hyperbranched polymers are characterized by very high solubilities and unusually low solution viscosities when compared to linear analogs. This is a result of their globular shape and lack of crystallinity. The preparation and selected properties of two types of hyperbranched polymers, polyphenylene and polyesters, is discussed.
