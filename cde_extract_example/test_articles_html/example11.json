Kremers, E.W. Meijer REACTIVE FUNCTIONAL POLYMERS Laboratory of Organic Chemistry, Eindhoven University of TechnoloAy; PO. Box 513, 5600 MD Eindhoven, Netherlands Accepted 13 January 1995 The synthesis and characterization of two chiral dendrimers, 1 and 2, in their racemic form is presented. The chirality is based on the construction of 4 constitutionally different, but chemically similar, branches to an achiral core. A multi-substituted pentaerythritol derivative is used as core and Frdchet's aromatic-ether dendritic wedges of different generation are used as branches. The synthetic approach makes use of the fact that the 4 branches are attached consecutively by a selective deprotection of the core. Both chiral dendrimers of different size have been synthesized from the same precursor. tH-NMR spectroscopy indicates an overall chiral shape for 1, while for both 1 and 2 stratified structures are observed. Several attempts to resolve both dendrimers into their individual enantiomers have not been successful so far, giving rise to a discussion on the degree of chirality of these dendrimers of nanometer dimensions. Keywords: Chirality; Dendrimer; Pentaerythritol 1. Introduction Recently, dendritic macromolecules have received considerable interest due to their hyperbranched polymeric structure and unique threedimensional architecture [1,2]. Dendrimers, with typical diameters of 3-10 nn, emanate from a central core and have a well-defined number of generations and end groups. These spherical structures are synthesized in a stepwise way via a repetitive reaction sequence; routes that are either convergent or divergent in character sequence [3-15]. Dendrimers also promise to be excellent materials for the study of chirality at the mesoscopic level. The assembly of chiral dendritic structures can be subdivided * Corresponding author. 1381-5148/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved. SSDI1381-5148(95)00013-5 into 5 classes, according to Seebach et al. [16]: (1) a chiral core with non-chiral branch units; (2) a non-chiral core with chiral branch units; (3) a chiral core as well as chiral branch units; (4) constitutionally different branches attached to a chiral core; and (5) constitutionally different branches attached to a non-chiral core. A variety of chiral dendrimers have been synthesized using one of these methods [16-18]. (For chiral one- and two-dimensional cascade molecules see Refs. [19-21].) However, almost all examples presented so far are representatives of the above-mentioned classes 1-3. Most attention has been paid to chiral dendrimers using a chiral building block in the last generation, whilst no peculiar chiroptical properties have been presented. In our view, the most exciting properties of chiral dendrimers will be found 138 J.A.

Comparison of chiral dendrimer 1 with 5-ethyl-S-propylundecane. in macromolecules with constitutionally different branches attached to an achiral core (i.e. class 5). Recently, we presented the synthesis of the first example of such a chiral dendrimer in its racemic form based on pentaerythritol with 4 aromaticether dendritic wedges of different generation [22] (1). It represents the macromolecular counterpart of 5-ethyl-5-propylundecane (Fig. 1), a textbook example in the study of optical activity of conformationally flexible molecules [2325]. (For a discussion on the related subject of cryptochirality see Ref. [26].) In order to study this type of chiral dendrimers in more detail we prepared dendrimers 1 and 2 (see Fig. 2 for structure of 2), using a slightly different approach. The latter is the higher generation equivalent of 1. In this paper, we present the synthesis and characterization of these chiral dendrimers of class 5. With these dendrimers we have studied chirality at the nanoscopic level and addressed the topic of `degree of chirality' [27]. 5-ethyl-5-propylundecane 2. Results 2.1. Synthesis of the dendrimers The synthesis of our chiral dendrimers is based on the preparation of aromatic-ether dendritic wedges according to Hawker and Frhet [9] and on the preparation of a multi-substituted (pentaerythritol) core molecule. Repetitive, alternating deprotection and coupling of the core with a dendritic wedge furnished chiral dendrimers 1 and 2 in their racemic form. Scheme 1 shows the retrosynthetic scheme for this procedure. The synthesis of the multi-substituted pentaerythritol derivative, partially based on a method described by Vik [28], is shown in Scheme 2. Starting compound diethyl (ethoxymethylene)malonate (3) was converted into diethyl (diethoxymethyl)malonate (4) in 78% yield by reaction with sodium ethoxide in absolute ethanol at 50 for 4 h. The introduction of a hydroxyl group by means of an aldol condensation was effected by treating 4 J.A.

Synthesis of intermediate 8. with potassium carbonate and formaldehyde in anhydrous DMF, rendering alcohol 5 in 82% yield. Protection of the hydroxyl moiety of 5 as its MEM ether was accomplished by a standard method, using MEM chloride and diisopropylethylamine in anhydrous dichloromethane [29] to give MEM ether 6 (81%). Subsequent reduction of the ester moieties of 6 with lithium aluminum hydride in anhydrous diethyl ether furnished diol 7 in excellent yield. Having obtained diol 7, the necessity of discrimination between the two apparently similar alcohol functionalities is obvious. To accomplish this, two methods are available. Firstly, both hydroxy groups can be converted into the bistert-butyldimethylsilylether, followed by monohydrolysis using anhydrous ZnBr2 in CHZC12, yielding 8 in 64% yield [22]. Alternatively, the addition of one equivalent of sodium hydride to diol 7 in anhydrous THF, followed by the addition of one equivalent of silylating agent (TBDMSchloride) gave the desired racemic monosilylated alcohol 8 in 65% yield [30].

At this stage of the synthesis, we have investigated a large number of methods to obtain one of both enantiomers in excess; however, all attempts have not been successful yet. A fast check for the presence of enantiomeric excess was found in using 'H-NMR spectroscopy and a chiral shift reagent (europium(III) tris-[3(heptafluorohydroxymethylene)-n-camphorato]) [31]. With the desired monosilylated (racemic) alcohol 8 in hand, the remainder of the synthesis comprised the coupling of the various dendritic wedges to the core molecule, alternated with the deprotection of the various protecting groups, as can be seen in Scheme 3. Clearly, compound 8 possesses a free hydroxyl moiety and is therefore suitable for coupling with the first dendritic wedge. For this purpose, we selected [G-1]-Br, as this leaves the possibility to synthesize two different dendrimers by variation of the last step in the synthesis. Consequently, 8 was subjected to a standard Williamson ether synthesis, using sodium hydride as base, anhydrous THF as solvent, and [G-1]-Br as the dendritic wedge, J.A.

Next, the acetal moiety was hydrolyzed by treatment with a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in refluxing acetone for 30 min, followed by sodium borohydride reduction of the intermediate aldehyde, thus giving alcohol 12 142 J.A. Kremers, E. W Meijer /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 137-144 (78%). Again, the free hydroxyl group was used for the coupling with another dendritic wedge in a Williamson ether synthesis, in this case [G-3]Br, rendering 13 in good yield. Deprotection of 13, furnishing 14, could be accomplished in good yield using chlorocatecholborane in anhydrous dichloromethane within a few hours [32]. (Deprotection of 13 was also effected by heating in acetone under refiux for 48 h in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate.) The last step in our synthesis consisted again of a Williamson ether synthesis to connect the remaining wedges to the pentaerythritol core. The wedges used in this step are [G-0]-Br (benzyl bromide) and [G-4]-Br, respectively, yielding the chiral dendrimers 1 and 2 in their racemic forms in good yield. After chromatographic purification the dendrimers were obtained in a purity of more than 99% as determined by means of HPLC with silica Lichrosorb 60 as stationary phase. 2.2. Characterization The chiral dendrimers 1 and 2 are fully characterized using 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy while their purity was analyzed by means of HPLC. The benzylic resonances in the 1H-NMR spectrum of 1 in CDC13 are well-resolved and each peak could be ascribed to a separate layer, revealing the stratified structure of this dendrimer [22]. The same phenomenon was observed with the larger dendrimer as well, thus indicating the stratified structure in this case too. By recording the 1H-NMR spectrum of 1 in C6D6 and C6DSN, respectively, a remarkable difference in chemical shift for the pentaerythrityl protons (C6D6) or for the most inner benzylic protons (CSDSN) was observed. The difference in structure of the two largest substituents in 1, i.e, [G-2] and [G-3], is 17 Q-bonds apart from the pentaerythrityl protons and 15 a-bonds apart from the most inner benzylic protons, being too far from the core to differentiate between the CHZ-groups in electronic properties. Therefore, we propose that dendrimer 1 can adopt an overall macroscopic chiral structure in solution, which strongly depends on the solvent and/or complexation of 1 with solvent. This difference for the resonances of the inner protons was not observed for dendrimer 2 and, hence, no conclusion on the presence of a macroscopic chiral structure was drawn in this case. Another interesting feature of the 1H-NMR spectrum is the sharpness of the peaks, compared to the size of the molecule. The reason for this is found in the substantial conformational freedom present in the molecule; considerable peak broadening appears only at temperatures below 230 K. However, no evidence has been found for the existence of a preferred conformer and no diastereotopic protons could be detected. The chromatographic behaviour of the dendrimers prepared in general and of 2 in particular shows some peculiar properties. Eluating with pure dichloromethane gives rise to very high retention times (k' = ca. 50) for 2, while most contaminations have relatively short retention times (k' = 1-4). Addition of only very small amounts of a polar co-eluent capable of forming relatively strong hydrogen-bonds (e.g. 1-3% tertbutylmethyl ether or 100 ppm water) markedly reduces the retention time of 2 (k' approaching 0). The addition of polar, aprotic acetonitrile as co-eluent, however, gives rise to an intermediate retention time (k' = ca. 3). Obviously, a specific cooperative interaction between dendrimer and polar stationary phase is present in the absence of H-bond breaking solvents. 2.3. Attempts to resolve both enantiomers of 1 and 2 Several attempts to resolve both chiral dendrimers 1 and 2 were carried out using HPLC with chiral stationary phases. For dendrimer 1 no resolution could be accomplished using various chiral stationary phases. The employed stationary phases include: microcrystalline cellulose triacetate, (-)-TAPA impregnated on silica, Pirkle phase ((R)-DNBPG covalently bonded to silica), and (+)-poly(triphenylmethylmethacrylate) co- J.A. Kremers, EW Meijer /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 137-144 valently bonded to silica. For dendrimer 2 the separation experiments are still in progress. 3. Discussion The successful synthesis of the two chiral dendrimers 1 and 2 in their racemic form is based on a convergent approach, in which the two dendrimers are made out of the same precursor in the last step. For dendrimer 1 benzyl bromide ([G-0]-Br) was used in the coupling of the last wedge to the core, while for dendrimer 2 [G4]-Br was employed as the last wedge. In both cases, the last step proceeds well and satisfactory yields are obtained. Overall yields of 4.9 and 4.5% are obtained in the 12-step synthesis of 1 and 2, respectively, from diethyl (ethoxymethylene)malonate 3. Both NMR spectroscopy and HPLC analysis show the remarkable properties of both dendrimers with respect to chirality. The stratified structure is clearly observed in the 1H-NMR spectra due to the chiral nature of the dendrimer. In certain solvents (e.g. C6D6) the core protons of 1 differ for the 4 substituents, from which it is concluded that an overall chiral shape is present. On the other hand, we were unsuccessful in our attempts to resolve the chiral dendrimers in both enantiomers. The reasons why are purely speculative at this stage, a possible explanation arrived during our investigations. A chiral recognition at the molecular level of dendrimer and stationary phase seems impossible due to the differences in dimensions of chirality. The enantioselectivity of the stationary phases used in almost all studies is based on molecular recognition using specific secondary interactions [33]. However, our dendrimers receive their chirality from a more macroscopic feature, since the molecular properties of most wedges are roughly similar. Hence, no mechanism for resolution is present, despite the evidence for an overall chiral shape. Another issue of direct concern to the chiral dendrimers prepared in this study deals with the question: which dendrimer is `more chiral', 1 or 2? Many theoretical studies are devoted to the 143 degree of chirality of molecules [27]; however, none of them are dealing with well-organized macromolecules with their atoms restricted in a confined chiral space. It has been proposed by Mislow [34] to assess the degree of chirality in our series of dendrimers by looking at the relative differences in weight between the various substituents. The 4 substituents in the dendrimers can be indexed by a characteristic n, such that the number of aromatic rings in each substituent is given by Nn = 2' -1. Thus, n(1) = 1,2,3,4 andNn(1)=1,3,5,7;n(2)=2,3,4, 5 and Nn (2) = 3, 7, 15, 31; and so forth. The absolute difference between the N's of substituents n and n + 1 does indeed increase indefinitely: 0 = Nn+1 - Nn = 2n. On the other hand, the relative difference is given by the ratio R = (Nn+1 - Nn)/(Nn+1 + Nn). Thus R(1) = 0.50, 0.40, 0.36; R(2) = 0.40, 0.36, 0.35; and so forth. In the limit, R(oo) = 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Hence, the series of R converges to a limit. This trend in R's shows that the dendrimers become increasingly achiral with an increase in n and Nn. However, in this analysis the obvious problem of excluded volumes is ignored. The approach is supposed to be valid for the relatively small dendrimers 1 and 2. From a more macroscopic (volume or weight) point of view it will be interesting to know what happens when the situation of a chiral body with restricted mobility at high generations is reached. Research to investigate this topic in much more detail is in progress in our laboratories. Acknowledgements We would like to thank Prof. Dr. K.

The synthesis and characterization of two chiral dendrimers, 1 and 2, in their racemic form is presented. The chirality is based on the construction of 4 constitutionally different, but chemically similar, branches to an achiral core. A multi-substituted pentaerythritol derivative is used as core and Fr\u00e9chet's aromatic-ether dendritic wedges of different generation are used as branches. The synthetic approach makes use of the fact that the 4 branches are attached consecutively by a selective deprotection of the core. Both chiral dendrimers of different size have been synthesized from the same precursor. 1H-NMR spectroscopy indicates an overall chiral shape for 1, while for both 1 and 2 stratified structures are observed. Several attempts to resolve both dendrimers into their individual enantiomers have not been successful so far, giving rise to a discussion on the degree of chirality of these dendrimers of nanometer dimensions.
