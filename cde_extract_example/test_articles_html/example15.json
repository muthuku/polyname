The thermodynamic analysis of ion exchange of amino acid cation gives valuable insight into ion exchange of peptides and proteins. Keywords: Ion exchange; Amino acid; Thermodynamic function 1. Introduction Although numerous papers in the literature have reported the use of ion exchange for analytical or large-scale separation of amino acids, up to now no systematic investigation of thermodynamic functions for the ion exchange of amino acids with hydrogen appears to have been reported. There have only been a few systematic investigations of ion-exchange equilibrium properties of amino acids. Seno and Yamabe [1,2] have examined the equilibrium uptake of a number of amino acids by both cation- and anion-exchange resins in a single-component system. Feitelson [3,4] has carried out studies on the uptake of amino acids at their isoelectric pH by a cation-exchange resin, in the presence of a large excess of buffer. Yu and Wang [5] and Yu et al. [6] have reported the effects of equilibrium on the dynamics of chromatographic columns used for the separation of amino acids.

[7] have employed a complex model and derived the equations for ion exchange of amino acids in unbuffered solution. Wang et al. [8] have presented a much simpler model for uptake of amino acids at given pH. Helfferich [9] derived the equations describing equilibrium uptake of amino acids by strong acid cation-exchange resin as a function of pH and concentrations of amino acid and added electrolyte or buffer. All amino acids have one a-amino group, one a-carboxy group, and a side chain (R). According to their side functional groups, amino acids can be classified into neutral, acidic and basic amino acids. The structure of amino acids can be generally represented as NHZCHRCOOH. In aqueous solution the following equilibrium protonation reactions of neutral amino acids [7,10] take place: NH3CHRCOO- +H+ OHI NHSCHRCOOH Kl 30 Z. Tao et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 29-33 NH2CHRC00- + H+ NHSCHRCOO xa (2) the concentration of one positively charged amino acid can be calculated from: _ CA (3) CA+ 1 + K1/l0pH + K1Kz/102pH where Kl and KZ are the dissociation constants of the amino acid, and CA is the total concen tration of amino acid. For amino acids that have an ionizable R group, an additional dissociation reaction should be considered. Basic amino acids have a basic side chain, in aqueous solution, the two positively charged species exist at low pH values. Acidic amino acids have an acidic side chain, only one positively charged species exists at low pH values in aqueous solution. The aims of this paper are: (1) to determine the thermodynamic functions for the ion exchange of amino acids with hydrogen at pH < pKl; and (2) to understand the fundamental ion-exchange behavior of amino acids. A strong acid cation-exchange resin was chosen for this study because its charge density and capacity do not change with pH. Seven neutral amino acids (L-Trp, L-Phe, L-Ser, L-Leu, D,L-Thr, LAla and L-Gly), one acidic amino acid (L-Glu) and two basic amino acids (L-Lys and L-Arg) were studied in a given pH range, and within the pH range tested, the amino groups are always positively charged. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials 001X7 resin (sulfonate polystyrene resin, 0.02-0.04 cm radius, 7% DVB, made in Shanghai Resin Factory) was used. Prior to the experiment, the resin was pretreated by repeated washes with NaOH and HCl solutions, converted to the hydrogen form with 1 N HCI, and thoroughly rinsed with distilled deionized water. It was then put on a shallow glass dish placed inside the desiccator over the saturated NaCI solution until a constant weight was reached. The desiccator was placed in a thermostat (25 2). The capacity of this resin was 3.69 t 0.02 mEq/g. All of the amino acids were purchased from Cheng Don Chemicals Factory and Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, and were biochemical reagents. All of the amino acids were obtained in crystalline form, used without further purification and made a previous analysis by means of titration in glacial acetic acid. Using a TRONAC Model 1250 automatic microtitration calorimeter, enthalpy changes of the protonation of amino acids and of the sorption of amino acids at isoelectric pH were obtained. 2.2. Procedure 2.2.1. Equilibrium experiment The amino acid solutions were prepared with distilled deionized water and the pH values (<pKl) were adjusted with 1 M HCI. The equilibrium experiments were performed by the batch method at 25 1. The weighted amounts of resin were first placed in a glass-stoppered flask, with a definite volume of the amino acid solution added, the flasks were shaken gently for 1 week or more until no further change in solution composition was to be noted. After equilibration, aliquots of the resultant solution were pipetted off and analyzed to determine the total concentration of amino acid and pH value. The total concentrations of amino acid in equilibrium solutions were determined colorimetrically with ninhydrin as chromogen [11] by spectrophotometer Model 721 (made in Shanghai Third Analysis Instrument Factory), the equilibrium pH values were measured with a pHS-3 type pH meter (made in Shanghai Second Analysis Instrument Factory). The amino acid concentration and hydrogen ion concentration of the resin phase were then calculated from the total resin capacities and the initial and final concentrations of the solution phases. Z. Tao et al. !Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 29-33 2.2.2. Microtitration calorimetry experiment Amino acid solutions (0.05 M) were prepared with distilled deionized water and the pH value was adjusted with HCl or NaOH, and kept at ionic strength 0.5 M KCI. An amount of 25 ml of 0.05 M amino acid solution was pipetted into 25-ml Dewar flasks placed in the calorimetric system. HCl solution was the titrant. The reactive solution was thermostated at 298.15 0.03 K by means of a thermistor in the water bath, and then the input executive statement to automatic microtitration calorimeter and enthalpy changes of the protonation of amino acids' caCOO- were obtained by fitting the calorimetric curves. Forty points were required for every calorimetric curve. The titration rate was 0.1049 ml/18 s for each point and the time that elapsed between successive additions of HCl solution was 30 s which was suggested by the preliminary experiments. The result was the average value of 3 experimental data. The ion-exchange resin in H form was titrated by the amino acid solution at isoelectric pH, and the enthalpy change of the sorption of amino acid dipolar ion obtained. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Standard free energy change The exchange of an amino acid cation NH~ CHRCOOH for hydrogen ion on a cationexchange resin can be described by the following stoichiometric relationship: ResH + NH3 CHRCOOH K1 ResNH3 CHRCOOH + H+ (4) 0 HH' The concentration equilibrium constant for NH3 CHRCOOH-H+ exchange is defined: KI - [ResNH3 CHRCOOH][H+] (5) [NH3 CHRCOOH][H+] where the concentrations with bars refer to the inside of the ion-exchange resin. 31 The KH for Trp, Phe, Ser, Leu, Thr, Ala, Gly and Glu are calculated and listed in Table 1. For basic amino acid, at pKl < pH < 7, the predominant species is the one positively charged species, NH3 CH(COO-)RNH3 , and the ion-exchange reaction (Eq. 4) take place; at pH < pKl, the predominant species is the two positively charged species, NH3CH (COOH)RNH3 , and taking into account the effect of counter-ion valences, the ion-exchange reaction (Eq. 4) of one positively charged species, NH3 CHRCOOH, can be neglected, in the aqueous solutions. The sole stoichiometric ion exchange is: 2ResH + NH3 CH(COOH)RNH3 K2 H r ResZNH3CH(COOH)RNH3 + 2H+ (6) 12 4H The concentration equilibrium constant for NH3 CH(COOH)RNH3 - H+ exchange is defined: _ [ReszNH3 CH(COOH) RNH3 ][H]2 KH [H]2[NH3 CH(COOH)RNH3 ] (7) The KH for Arg and KH for Lys are also listed in Table 1. Since as can be seen from Table 1, the selectivity of the amino acid counter-ion for strong acid cation-exchange resin in hydrogen form is small, and is insignificantly changed by rises in the concentration of the amino acid counter ion in the ion-exchange resin [12], it may be concluded that this ion-exchange system can be considered a quasi-ideal system, and it may be attributed to the weak electrostatic attraction between large amino acid counter ion and fixed ionic group as compared with small mineral counter ion. Therefore the value of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant approximates the value of the concentration equilibrium constant: AG' = -RT In KH (or - RT In KH2) (8) where R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. We recall that the activity 32 Z.

Standard enthalpy and entropy changes The dipolar ion of amino acid, as we know, can be adsorbed by the hydrogen clays and the strong acid cation-exchange resin in hydrogen form [19,20], this process may be represented by the proton transfer reaction: ResH + NH3 CHRCOO- isoelectric pH values. Indeed the proton transfer reaction (Eq. 9) is the sum of ion-exchange reaction (Eq. 4) and the protonation of amino acid (Eq. 1), therefore, the Kt = KH x Kl, and 0 Ht = 0 HH + A H1. The microtitration calorimetric experiments for the sorptions of amino acids on the strong acid cation-exchange resin in the aqueous solutions at isoelectric pH values have indicated that the OHt 0, and hence the A HH = - 0 Hl .The 0 Ht (= 0) of sorptions of alanine, glycyl leucine and glycyl leucyl valine dipolar ions onto the strong acid cationexchange resin SDV-3 were also found from the way the isotherms depend on temperature [12]. The AHH (= -OHl) values for 10 amino acids have been obtained and are also listed in the Table 1. As a general rule we have: K, ( ) ResNH3CHRCOOH (9) AG' = AHH + TOSH 10 0 H, The actual transfer may take place at the sub strate surface or in the solution in the vicin ity of the surface, followed by exchange of NH3 CHRCOO- with H30+ at the surface. As can be seen from Eqs. 9 and 4, a fact of great importance for sorption of amino acids onto ion exchange resins in hydrogen form is the amino acids exist as cations and not zwitterions, even if the sorptions take place in aqueous solution at where 0 SH is the entropy change of the ionexchange reaction (Eq. 4), and then TASH is the difference between AGO and AHH. The TOSH values are listed in Table 1. For basic amino acid, the similar relationship can be obtained, the AG2O, OHH and TOSH of the ion-exchange reaction (Eq. 6) calculated and also listed in the Table 1. Z. Tao et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 29-33 4. Discussion As can be seen from column 5 of Table 1, it is of particular interest that the positive enthalpy change sign appears for every amino acid, and this result demonstrates that the interactions between the amino acid cations and the fixed ionic groups are weaker than the interactions between the hydrogen ion and the fixed ionic groups. The simplest interpretation of the positive enthalpy effect (a positive change in enthalpy) seems to be that it is due to a steric hindrance when an amino acid cation approaches a fixed ionic group and the weak electrostatic interaction between a large amino acid cation and a fixed ionic group. Though there is usually an additional interaction between organic ions and the ion-exchange resin [12], it is too weak to compensate the decrease in electrostatic interaction energy. The distinctive aspect of amino acid cationhydrogen ion exchange for pH < pK1 is the rise in entropy for every system (column 6 of Table 1), and the positive entropy effect (a positive change in entropy), must obviously be due to the additional microstates that appear as a result of local weak additional interaction between amino acid and ion-exchange resin and of the complex structure of amino acid as compared with the small mineral ion. A set of weak interactions at low energy leads to the appearance of a series of microstates for the resinate of amino acid cation and to an increased system entropy. As mentioned above, the positive enthalpy effect indicates that the selectivity for the amino acid is attributed to the positive entropy effect, and the gain in enthalpy is not fully reflected in an equivalent increase of the free energy changes due to concomitant changes in the entropy of same sign as the OHH. On the basis of the above results and discussion, it may be concluded that: (1) the ionexchange behavior of amino acid is much more complex than that of small mineral ion; (2) the thermodynamic analysis of ion-exchange of amino acid cation gives valuable insight into the ion exchange of peptides and proteins. However, 33 the challenging question of whether the overall thermodynamic quantity can be separated into contributions from electrostatic and dispersion forces, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds, cannot be answered by this investiga- tion.
