Diagonal 647, 08028 Barcelona, Spain Received 27 June 1994; accepted in revised form 2 February 1995 Abstract The acid-base properties and the copper(II)-complexing behaviour of the polynucleotide polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) were studied by means of potentiometric, spectrophotometric and circular dichroism titrations in a working aqueous medium of 0.15 M ionic strength and at 37. Spectrophotometric and circular dichroism data were treated with a multivariate curve resolution procedure that is successfully applied to the study of macromolecular systems, where polyfunctional, conformational and/or polyelectrolytic effects may be present. This procedure allows different sets of spectrometric titrations of the multi-equilibria systems to be analyzed simultaneously. Three spectroscopically different species are detected for poly(C) in the pH range 3.1-7.0. Two of them are forms with different protonation extent and different conformation, and the other is the unprotonated form of poly(C). One new species is detected in the presence of Cu(II) ion. Keywords: Polycytidylic acid; Self modelling curve resolution; Copper(II) complexation; Conformational changes 1. Introduction This work is part of a wider study concerning the interpretation of metal ions and proton interactions with nucleic acids and their constituents in aqueous solution under physiological conditions [1-6]. In this study, the acid-base properties and the copper(II)-complexing behaviour of the polynucleotide polycytidylic acid (Scheme la) are studied by means of potentiometric, spectrophotometric UV-visible (UV-VIS) and circular dichroism (CD) titrations in a working aqueous medium of 0.15 M ionic strength and at * Corresponding author. 1381-5148/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

The study of conformational and structural transitions in synthetic polynucleotides such as poly(C) is important for a better understanding of the structures and interactions in naturally occurring nucleic acids. These homopolynucleotides allow evaluation of constants of ion binding to predetermined types of bases [7,8]. This study has a significant interest because metal ions have profound effects on the structure and biological activity of nucleic acids and monoand polynucleotides. They alter the coding specificity of polynucleotides acting as templates for protein synthesis and are required for stabilizing 2 E. Casassas et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 1-14 the structure of tRNA. Their role in unwinding and rewinding of the double helix and in degradation of polynucleotides has been demonstrated [9]. The impact of copper ions on the conformation of nucleic acids is equally dramatic and of potential significance in disturbing the function of the genetic material [10]. The homopolymer poly(C) has long been known to occur in helical configuration in aqueous solution [11,12]. It adopts two different, highly ordered forms, one at pH 7.0 and the other at around pH 4.5. For the low pH structure, a double helix with parallel chains and hemiprotonated base-pair (C)H+-(C) has been proposed (Scheme 1b). On the other hand, it was shown that poly(C) in neutral aqueous solution NH O=P N CHZH~o'\\H N O OH NH O=P -O O N \\ ~ CH Z o'\\N O H~H O OH NH 2 O=P-O O N CH Z a~N O H~H O OH O=P O probably occurs as a left-handed single helix [13]. However, no studies have been performed in order to evaluate and quantify conformational changes and copper(II) complexing behaviour in poly(C) due to pH changes. In order to carry out this study, potentiometric pH titrations coupled with a spectrometric detection (UV-VIS and CD) have been performed in a wide pH range. The study of the acid-base properties and metal-ion complexing behaviour in systems that contain macromolecular ligands is hindered by the fact that the law of mass action ruling the acid-base and complexation equilibria is valid only separately for each of the reaction sites of the macromolecule since several additional secondary effects must be considered.

Casassas et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 1-14 ondary effects have been classified into 3 types [14]: (1) polyfunctional effects assigned to differences in chemical nature and in electrostatic and steric environments of the coordination sites in the macromolecule; (2) conformational changes caused by the changes in pH and ionic strength of the medium or by the content of complexed ion; and (3) polyelectrolytic effects caused by the ionization of major sites of the macromolecule yielding changes in the local electric field at the surface of the macromolecule. All these effects contribute to the stability of the species formed and their relative importance is difficult to define since it varies with the degree of site occupation (complexation or protonation). The mathematical procedures used in the numerical treatment of the experimental data obtained in the study of the acid-base or complexing equilibria, can be classified into two main groups. In one of them, the traditional leastsquares curve fitting approaches are included, which are based on the postulation of a chemical model, that is, the postulation of an initial set of species defined by their stoichiometric coefficients and formation constants, which are then refined in the least squares minimization. These mathematical procedures also require the fulfilment of the mass balance and of the mass action law. The compliance of the mass action law implies that each equilibrium is characterized by a unique equilibrium constant. The other group includes procedures that are not based on an initial postulation of a chemical model and that do not have the requirement of the compliance of the mass action law. These procedures are based on factor analysis techniques [15]. They can be used as an independent tool for model selection, in order to validate the results obtained with the traditional least-squares procedures, but they also provide a new approach for the study of equilibria interactions in systems where it is difficult or even impossible to study them using the traditional least-squares approach, such as multiequilibria systems involving macromolecular ligands [16,17]. In the present work, our previously reported 3 multivariate curve resolution approach based on factor analysis techniques is applied for the study of the interaction of H+ and Cu(II) ions with poly(C). This method was developed for the detection of the number of species present in the system, for the estimation of the concentration profile and the individual spectra of the species in equilibrium along a spectroscopic titration and, in this particular case, for the deduction of polyelectrolytic effects and conformational changes on the polynucleotide. Two related spectrometric techniques were used, UV-VIS normal absorption and circular dichroism absorption, the latter being a convenient method to follow conformational changes of macromolecules. 2. Experimental 2.1. Reagents and solutions Hydrochloric acid, copper(II) oxide, sodium chloride (Merck, analytical reagent grade) and polycytidylic acid sodium salt (poly(C), Sigma) were used without further purification. All the solutions were prepared using C02-free deionized water. Stock solutions of copper(II) ion were standardized by iodometric titration. Solutions of poly(C) were prepared from a known amount of the solid reagent and dissolution in the ionic medium used in this study. The concentration of the solutions of poly(C) was referred to the concentration of the nucleotide cyclic monophosphate, which is the monomeric unity in the polynucleotide chain. C02-free sodium hydroxide (Merck, analytical reagent grade) solutions were prepared by Kolthoff's procedure [18] and standardized with potassium hydrogenphthalate. The ionic strength of the measured solutions was kept at 0.15 M by adding, when necessary, the appropriate amount of sodium chloride. 2.2. Apparatus Visible absorption spectra at 37 were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda-19 spec- 4 E. Casassas et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 1-14 trophotometer interfaced to an IBM personal computer. Circular dichroism spectra at 37 were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (belonging to the Serveis Cientific-Tnics, University of Barcelona), controlled by a Jasco software on a personal computer. pH measurements were performed with a Orion model 701A pH meter (with a precision of f0.1 mV) and a combined Ross pH electrode (Orion 81-02). Titrant solution was added with a Metrohm 655 Dossimat autoburette equipped with an exchange unit of 5 cm 3 (with a precision of .005 cm'). Sample solutions were titrated in a double-walled vessel maintained at 37.0 0.1 by circulating water and stirred magnetically under a continuous flow of nitrogen. 2.3. Procedure Potentiometric titrations were carried out automatically. The potentiometric assembly was controlled by an HP 9816 computer via an HP 3241 A data acquisition control unit (for details, see [19]). For every titration, a previous calibration of the potentiometric cell was performed from a strong acid-strong base titration by Gran's method [20]. The electromotive force (e.m.f.) data for the poly(C)-H system were obtained during the titration, with a standardized solution of hydrochloric acid, of neutral solutions containing different initial poly(C) concentrations. The e.m.f. data for the poly(C)-Cu(II) system were obtained during the potentiometric Table 1 Experimental conditions of the potentiometric titrations performed Titration System pH range [Ligand]o [Cu(11)],, number (MM) (MM) 1 Poly(C)-H 2.57-10.03 3.38 - 2 2.37- 9.19 2.02 - 3 5.53- 2.38 1.99 - 4 5.53- 2.26 3.97 - 5 5.61- 2.60 3.31 - 6 5.56- 2.47 3.59 - 7 5.59- 2.57 3.16 - 8 Poly(C)-Cu(11) 2.24- 5.52 1.27 1.26 9 5.57- 2.09 1.56 1.56 titration, with a standardized hydrochloric acid solution, of neutral solutions containing different copper(II) ion concentrations and different ligand-to-metal ion concentration ratios. Some titrations were carried out by adding a titrant solution of copper(II) chloride to pH-fixed solutions of poly(C). Solutions for the UV-VIS and CD spectrometric studies were obtained during the potentiometric titrations. After each titrant addition the pH of the solution was measured and the UV-VIS or CD spectrum recorded with measurements taken every 1 nm, between 220 and 310 nm. For the UV-visible studies, the solution being titrated was introduced continuously into the flow cell in the UV-VIS spectrophotometer with the aid of a peristaltic pump. Instead, the CD titrations should be performed discontinuously because of the limitations of the particular CD spectrometer used. The titrations were finished at pH around 3.2 because of the formation of a precipitate at this pH range. The experimental conditions of the titrations performed are given in Tables 1 and 2. 2.4.

In the present paper, a model-free method is applied for the study of acid-base and metal-complexing properties of poly(C). The method, based on factor analysis and multivariate curve resolution techniques, is explained elsewhere [5,21]. This method has been implemented in a small set of MATLAB [22] functions. Essentially, the data treatment consists of the following tasks. (1) Building up the data matrix D (NSOLN, NWAVE) which contains the UVVIS or CD spectra at the NWAVE wavelengths of the NSOLN mixtures obtained at the successive titration points of the spectroscopic titrations. More than one titration can be analyzed simultaneously (see Scheme 2 for data arrangement). (2) Estimation of the number of principal components NS present in each spectroscopic titration [15,23,24]. These principal components are considered equal to the number of absorbing species in the system. (3) Generalized Beer law equation in matrix form is solved iteratively by least squares (alternating least squares procedure, ALS) to obtain the matrices of individual spectra S and of concentration profiles C which best fit the data (Scheme 2). This iterative method starts with an initial estimation of the augmented C data matrix obtained from evolving factor analysis (EFA) profiles of the experimen- CHI PH,I PH.

A very useful possibility is building up of the augmented data matrix containing all the titrations for a spectrometric technique, including acid-base and complexation titrations (Scheme 2b). When the data analysis is performed over these augmented data matrices, the results improve since the number of possible solutions of the linear equation system (ALS procedure) decrease [5]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Poly (C) -H system The polynucleotide poly(C) presents no polyfunctional effect as it contains the same monomeric unit repeated along its structure: the cyclic nucleotide CMP Poly(C) has only one protonation site to be taken into account under the working conditions, which is the nitrogen atom in position 3 (N(3)) in the nitrogen base moiety. The first acidic group in the phosphate residue has a pKa value of acid dissociation lower than 1, and hence it is always deprotonated in the working pH range. In the polynucleotide, the protonation site is repeated along the molecule, conferring to poly(C) a polyelectrolytic character [14], which must be taken into account in the study of its acid-base properties. In this pa- 5,5 5,0 4,5 Y 4,0 o) _o 3.5 per, the poly(C)-H system has been studied by means of potentiometric and spectrometric (UV-VIS and CD) titrations. In Fig. 1, the plot of the logKproc, obtained from potentiometric results, of the N3 site in poly(C) as a function of the degree of protonation (aprot) is given. It shows the presence of different effects along the titration, dependent on the number of protonated positions. Therefore, poly(C) cannot be assimilated to a group of individual monomeric units, and the numerical treatment of the experimental data for the determination of stability constants cannot be performed using traditional least-squares curvefitting approaches, such as the SUPERQUAD program [27] for potentiometric data or the SQUAD program [28] for spectrometric data. From the potentiometric results only qualitative information can be extracted since a precipitate was obtained in the titration vessel at aProt higher than 0.25. In the spectrometric studies, it was possible to work with lower poly(C) concentrations (see Table 2) and, consequently, formation of precipitate was avoided in the pH range 3.2-7.0. Figure 2 shows a three-dimensional plot of the experimental UV spectra obtained along one of the acid-base titrations performed. Two main changes can be seen around pH 3 and 5.5.

These results are checked and eventually confirmed in the next steps of the data treatment. In Fig. 3, the initial estimates of the species concentrations obtained from EFA [25,26] is shown for one of the acid-base UV titrations. Similar plots are obtained for the other titrations performed. This plot shows the high degree of overlap between different species. These estimates are later used in the ALS optimization. Results obtained in the individual analysis of the different spectrometric titrations using the E. Casassas et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 7-14 constrained ALS procedure become unreliable because of the lack of selectivity, both in the pH and in the spectral direction. Instead, when the analysis is performed over the augmented data matrices obtained by the grouping of the titrations performed with the same technique (UV, titrations 1-3; CD, titrations 7-8), the results improve since the number of possible solutions of the linear equation system (ALS procedure) decrease. The residual fitting error (or) obtained is similar to that expected as experimental error (Table 3). This table also includes the % of the experimental data matrix explained by the reproduced data matrix. This one is calculated from the matrices of individual spectra and of concentration profiles obtained in the ALS procedure. Three spectroscopically different species are found for the poly(C) at pH values within the range of 3.2-7.0 in the acid-base titrations. The species that is formed beyond pH 5.5 is related to the unprotonated form of the N(3) nitrogen bases in poly(C). The other two species are related to different conformations of poly(C), depending upon the degree of protonation. The species that appears between pH 3.2 and 5.5 may be related to hemiprotonated base pairs (C)H+-(C) bound by hydrogen bonding (Scheme lb) and the species that appears at pH lower than 5 may be related to the N(3) protonated form of the nitrogen bases in poly(C). These results are in agreement with previous reports about different conformations of poly(C) in acidic medium using other experimental approaches [11-13]. The unitary UV and CD species spectra obtained with this treatment are shown in Fig. 4, and the species distribution from the UV study is shown in Fig. 5. While the 3 UV unit spectra obtained are quite different, the CD unit spectra obtained for the second and third species show the same wavelength positions for the positive and negative peaks. The only difference between both CD spectra are their intensity. When the CD spectra are normalized in order to have the same length it is possible to observe that the spectra of the second and third species are iden- 8 E.

Species spectra of the poly(C)-H system. (a) UV spectra. (b) CD spectra. Numbers identify the different species as in Fig. 3. sible explanation would be that the third species, which probably is present in a random coil conformation, has a CD spectrum of much lower intensity (similar to the baseline) compared to the other two spectra (both reflect ordered conformations of poly(C)). This fact is reflected in the experimental CD data as a decrease in the intensity of the spectra in the pH range where the acid-base equilibrium between the second and third species is present. However, only a certain decrease is observed, since the titrations cannot be carried out until complete protonation of the macromolecule due to the formation of precipitates at pH 3.2. In these circumstances, the mathematical ALS treatment seems to arrive at a partial minimum in which a linear combination of the real unit spectra for the second and third species is given as correct solution. Thus the results obtained for the third species (in relation to the shape of the unit CD spectrum and to the amount of this species formed at each pH value) should be considered critically. In this case, the results obtained from the UV titrations seem to be more reliable. Fig. 6 shows the variation of the protonation constant versus the degree of protonation in the poly(C)-H system, obtained from UV-VIS and CD data. The degree of protonation (aProt) is obtained from the ratio of the concentration of protons bound to nitrogen bases in poly(C) to the total concentration of bases: [LH j z]/2 [HL+] ~'prot = Ct + Ct where [LHt~z] refers to the concentration of bases in the conformation hemiprotonated, E.

As is shown in Scheme lb for the hemiprotonated conformation, two N bases and only one proton are involved. The concentrations obtained from data treatment for the hemiprotonated conformation are related to the total amount of nitrogen bases it contains (closure condition) and only half of this concentration should be considered as proton bound to nitrogen base. The protonation constant of poly(C) is calculated from the concentrations of protonated base and unprotonated base of poly(C) obtained from the constrained ALS procedure (species distribution plot) at each hydrogen ion concentration. aprot Kprot = [H+](1 - aprot) The value of the logarithm of the protonation constant extrapolated to aprot = 0 (apparent protonation constant), i.e., when poly(C) is completely unprotonated, is 4.2. This value is higher than that obtained for the cCMP-H system (3.87), which may be attributed to steric hinderance due to the polymeric structure of poly(C). Fig. 6 has, qualitatively, the same shape as that shown in Fig. 1, obtained from the po- 10 E. Casassas et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 1-14 tentiometric study. During protonation (until aprot = 0.5) of poly(C) an increase of positive charge is produced over the macromolecule surface, which should, due to a polyelectrolytic effect, oppose the continuation of the protonation process, whereas what is observed is just the opposite: the protonation of poly(C) is enhanced when the positive charge increases over the macromolecule, and the protonation constant consequently becomes higher. The explanation of this phenomenon, deduced from experimental data, is that the stabilization of protonated nitrogen in the cytosine base sites occurs because of base pairing through hydrogen bonding between protonated and deprotonated cytosine bases (Scheme lb). This is related to a transition from single-stranded to double-stranded poly(C) chains [11]. While unprotonated poly(C) has a helical single-stranded structure, half protonated poly(C) is present as double-stranded chains. The hydrogen bonding involves those nitrogen base sites which are also involved in the acid-base equilibria. Consequently, the changes in speciation observed from the spectrometric titrations performed are a consequence of conformational changes of the protonated poly(C), together with the acid-base equilibrium of the macromolecule. On the other hand, for aprot values greater than 0.5, the effect observed is to the contrary: it is more difficult, the addition of H+ to the polymer and the protonation constant falls when aprot rises. This fact can be explained as the break of the very stable double-stranded conformation to give the single-stranded protonated conformation, that finally gives a precipitate at pH lower than 3.2. Similar results have been obtained in the study of the homopolynucleotide polyadenilic acid [5]. However, the behaviour of other homopolynucleotides, such as polyuridylic acid [3] and polyinosinic acid [6], under the same working conditions, is quite different, which has been related to differences in the nature of the functional groups present in the nitrogen bases [29]. 3.2. Poly(C)-Cu(II) system Potentiometric study of the poly(C)-Cu(II) system was not possible because of the presence of a precipitate along the entire titration due to the large concentration of Cu(II) needed in the potentiometric study. So, the poly(C)-Cu(II) was only studied by means of spectrometric techniques. Fig. 7 shows a three-dimensional plot of the experimental circular dichroism spectra obtained in titration 11. This study has been carried out in the wavelength range where the absorption band of the ligand appears. Rank analysis of a single data matrix using UV or CD detection showed that 4 absorbing species are present in the poly(C)-Cu(II) system; thus, an additional species than in the poly(C)-H system was detected. These results are checked and eventually confirmed in the next steps of the data treatment. In Fig. 8, the initial estimates of the species concentrations obtained from EFA for one of the CD titrations are shown. This is an example of the results obtained by EFA of individual data matrices. Similar plots are obtained for the other UV-VIS and CD titrations performed. These EFA estimates are later used in the ALS optimization.

The best assignment found in the analysis of the augmented data matrices including both acidbase and complexation experimental data is that where the 3 species formed at more acidic media are common for both types of titrations (acidbase and complexation), and a fourth species appears when Cu(II) ion is present in the solution. This species is probably corresponding to a complex between Cu(II) ions and the unprotonated polynucleotide. This indicates that Cu(II) ions only interact with unprotonated poly(C) in a very similar way to the interaction of Cu(II) ions with related monomeric compounds, such as cCMP Table 3 includes the residual fitting error, which is similar to that expected as experimental error, and the % of the experimental data matrix explained by the reproduced one.

This is another reason to consider the total data treatment successful. The species distribution obtained from this procedure is shown in Fig. 10. The advantage of CD over UV absorption to solve conformational problems is even more evident in the study of complexation with Cu(II) ion because the spectrum of this complex and that of the unprotonated form of the ligand are much 12 E.

The lower CD intensity of the spectrum related to the complex compared with that of deprotonated poly(C) shows the breaking of the ordered left-handed single helix conformation of poly(C) at neutral pH when the metal ion interacts with the nitrogen bases. On the other hand, Fig. 10 shows how copper(II) ions cannot destroy the ordered double helix structure of poly(C) since there is no complexation at pH values lower than those where deprotonated poly(C) is already present in the solution. The equilibrium reaction considered for the complexation between Cu(II) ion and poly(C) is: Cuz+ + L -= (Cu - L)z+ where L is the unprotonated form of the ligand, Cu 2+ is the free Cu(II) ion, and (Cu-L)2+ is the complex formed. The complexation constant ((Kapp)comp) is calculated from the equation: _ [(Cu - L) 21 (Kapp)comp - [CUZ+]IL] _ [(Cu - L)2+1 ([CUZ+IT - [(CU - L)z+])[I-] where the concentration of the complex formed and that of the unprotonated poly(C) are obtained from the calculated species distribution and the concentration of free Cu(II) ion is ob- tained from the difference between the total concentration of Cu(II) ion and the concentration of complexed Cu(II) ion. The degree of complexation (acomP) is obtained from the equation: acomp = [CU +IT The plot of the logarithm of the complexation constant, (logKapp)comp, versus the degree of complexation (cxcomp) is shown in Fig. 11. The value of the logarithm of the complexation constant extrapolated t0 CYcomp = 0 is 2.83. This value is higher than that obtained for the Cu(II)-cCMP system (2.10), which may be attributed to the polymeric structure of the ligand. 4. Conclusions The simultaneous treatment of several titrations using spectrometric techniques (UV, CD) has been proved to considerably increase the resolving power and reliability of the data treatment. In particular, the proposed method allows the deduction of the number of independent macromolecular species present along a spectrometric acid-base titration of solutions containing poly(C) in the absence or presence of Cu(II) ion. Three spectrometrically different species are de- E.

Two of them are different conformational forms of protonated poly(C) depending upon the degree of protonation, and the other is related to unprotonated poly(C). One new species is detected in the presence of Cu(II) ion, which has been attributed to a complex formed between copper(II) ion and deprotonated poly(C). In addition, the proposed method allows the estimation of the species distribution with pH and the unit spectra of the species formed along the titrations. Stabilization by hydrogen bonding between base pairs explain the stabilization observed during protonation of poly(C). Instead, copper(II) ion complexation leads to a breaking of the singlestranded helical conformation of deprotonated poly(C).
