Driessen a,*, J. Reedijk a, D.C. Sherrington b, A. Zitsmanis e a Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden University, PO. Box 9502, 2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands h Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde, Thomas Graham Building, 295 Cathedral Street, Glasgow GI IXL, UK c Faculty of Chemist; Latvia University, 19 Rainis Boulevard, Riga 226098, Latvia Received 20 July 1994; accepted in revised form 2 February 1995 Abstract The azole ligands pyrazole, imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole have been immobilized onto poly(glycidyl methacrylate) p(GMA-O) and onto its sulfur analogue p(GMA-S), which contains a thiirane ring instead of an oxirane ring. The ligands were introduced using ring-opening reactions of the pendant oxirane or thiirane groups with the azoles, resulting in formation of the chelating ion-exchange resins PYROH, IMOH, TRIOH, TETOH, PYRSH, IMSH, TRISH and TETSH. The resins have been characterized by solid-state '3C cross-polarization and magic-angle spinning NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Batch extraction capacities were determined for the chloride salts of Cu z+, NiZ+, Cot+, Znz+ and Cdz+ in buffered solutions in the pH range 0.9-6.0. Both modified oxirane and thiirane resins are very selective for Cu 2+ in the presence of other divalent heavy metal ions. The maximum uptake capacities for Cu Z+ for the oxirane resins under non-competitive conditions are 0.28 mmol/g for TRIOH, 0.39 mmol/g for IMOH and 1.14 mmol/g for PYROH. The resin TETOH is an exception, and does not show any detectable uptake of MZ+ at all. The maximum uptake capacities for Cuz+ for the thiirane resins under non-competitive conditions are 0.87 mmol/g for TETSH, 0.96 mmol/g for TRISH, 0.58 mmol/g for IMSH and 0.98 mmol/g for PYRSH. The 4 thiirane resins also sorb noticeable amounts of Cd2+ and Zn2+, especially the resin PYRSH. The maximum uptakes of Cd2+ and Zn2+ for PYRSH are 0.65 and 0.74 mmol/g respectively. The complexation of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by the thiirane is ascribed to the presence of thiol groups. The resins PYROH and PYRSH have the highest uptake capacity for CUZ+ of all the resins tested. The M2+ -uptake sorption behavior of all the 8 resins show very steep pH-dependent curves, i.e. virtually no M2+ -uptake below pH 2.5 and, depending on the particular metal ion, maximum uptake at pH 5.5. The thiirane resins are stable in the presence of dilute mineral acid, as was shown by regeneration experiments performed with 1.0 M HZSOa.

Amines react by a facile ring-opening reaction of the pendant epoxy group, yielding resins with favorable ex- 16 PM. van Berkel et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 15-28 change kinetics for transition metal ions, due to the hydrophilic character of the resultant resin, viz. the ring-opening reaction generates a hydroxyl group on the carbon atom to the incoming amine [4-7]. In principle, the range of chelating structures available might be increased substantially if the thiirane analogue of p(GMA-O) resin were available, as has also been indicated by Kalal et al. [8]. Thiirane group containing resins prepared by Egawa et al. [9], based on polyethylenepolyamide modified 2,3-epithiopropyl methacrylate-divinylbenzene copolymer beads showed a good affinity for divalent transition metal ions. Recently a sulfur analogue of the GMA resin (abbreviated p(GMA-S)) was indeed synthesized by Moore et al. [10]. In this, the oxirane group is replaced by a thiirane group. Introduction of ligands onto this polymer is as simple as for the oxirane analogue, where in this case the ringopening reaction of the pendant thiirane group with amines or other nucleophiles generates a thiol group at the carbon atom. The straightforward immobilization of ligands onto polymer backbones like p(GMA-O) and p(GMA-S), produces ion-exchange resins which may be used in waste-water treatment and in regeneration of metal salts in industrial processes. Whether in these ion-exchange resins the metal binds only to the ligand, or whether the hydroxyl group and the thiol group also take part in metalion binding, thereby acting as additional donor sites, needs to be elucidated. In this paper we report the metal-ion uptake behavior of a series of azole ligands, i.e. pyrazole, imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole, immobilized onto the polymers p(GMA-O) and p(GMA-S). The aim of the present work has been to obtain more insight in the metal-binding affinities for heavy metal ions of the 4 different azole ligands. In addition, the influence of the pendant hydroxyl group and thiol group with respect to the metal-ion uptake behavior, had to be assessed.

Analysis and spectroscopy The surface areas of the starting polymers, p(GMA-O) and p(GMA-S), in the dry state were determined by NZ absorption, using a Micromeritics Accusorb 2100E, the data being evaluated by the B.E.T method [11]. Elemental analyses (C, H, N, O, S, Cl) were performed by the Microanalytical Services in the Chemistry Department at the University of Strathclyde (U.K.) and the Microanalytical Department of the Groningen University (The Netherlands). Metal analyses were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 3100 atomic absorption (AAS) and flame emission spectrometer connected to a Perkin-Elmer AS-90 autosampler using a non-linear calibration method. CP MAS 13C-NMR spectra (cross-polarization and magic-angle spinning) were recorded on a Bruker MSL 400 spectrometer, operating at 400.1 and 100.6 MHz for 1H and 13 C, respectively. The sample spinning rate was 7000 Hz. The cross-polarization contact time was 1.0 ms, with 3-4 s recycle delays between successive scans. Generally 500-2200 scans were employed. FT-IR spectra were recorded in KBr pellets (4000-400 cm-1) and in CsI pellets (700200 cm-1) on a Bruker IFS 113V spectrometer PM. van Berkel et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 15-28 connected to a Bruker IFS 113V data station. Solid-state electronic spectra (28,000-5000 cm-1) using the diffuse reflectance method with dried Zn(II)-loaded samples as a reference were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 330 spectrophotometer equipped with a data station. Electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a JEOL JES-RE2X ESR spectrophotometer equipped with a JEOL Esprit 330 data system at X-band frequencies at room temperature and at 77K. 2.2. Starting materials All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and were used as received. The polymer p(GMA-O) was prepared by suspension polymerization using a mixture of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) (6:4 v/v) with an equal volume of cyclohexanol-1-dodecanol (9:1 v/v) as a porogen, as described by Lindsay et al. [3]. The polymer p(GMA-S) was prepared by converting p(GMA-O) to the thiirane analogue, using thiourea in the presence of dilute HZS04 as a catalyst as described by Moore et al. [10]. The CP MAS 13C-NMR data of the polymer p(GMA-O) are (in ppm): 18.5 (CH3); 45.1 (-C- (polymer backbone)); 48.0 (CHz (epoxy)); 55.3 (-CHZ- (polymer backbone), CH (epoxy)); 63.8 (-O-CHz-epoxy ring, -O-CHZ-); 176.8 (C=O) and of the polymer p(GMA-S) (in ppm): 20.0 (CH3); 30.5 (CHZ (thiirane)); 38.3 (>CH-S (thiirane)); 45.2 (-C- (polymer backbone)); 55.1 (-CHz(polymer backbone)); 63.2 (-O-CHZ-); 69.2 (O-CHz-thiirane ring); 176.7 (C=O) [12-14]. Immobilization of the ligands pyrazole, imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole took place in toluene and were performed by Moore et al. [10] yielding the chelating ion-exchange resins PYROH, IMOH, TRIOH, TETOH, PYRSH, IMSH, TRISH and TETSH (see Scheme 1). The resins were characterized by CP MAS 13C-NMR spectroscopy and FT-IR spectroscopy. 17 2.3. Determination of the amount of SHgroups in the thiirane resins To determine the amount of SH groups of the thiirane resins quantitatively, two different methods were used, viz. the Ellman procedure [15-17] and an acid-base back titration [18]. For the Ellman procedure, 50 mg of resin and 25 ml of phosphate buffer pH 8 (1 = 0.8 M) were allowed to stand for 30 min. An amount of 10 ml of Ellman reagent (5,5'-dithio-bis(nitrobenzoic acid)) was added and the reaction mixture was shaken for 48 h. The resin was then filtered and washed with 50 ml of demineralized water. The absorbance of the filtrate was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 run. For the acid-base back titration, 500 mg of resin, 10 ml of 0.100 M NaOH and a few drops of phenolphthalein were shaken for 30 min, followed by titration of the solution with 0.100 M HCI. The unmodified polymer p(GMA-S) was also titrated to determine the amount of nonthiirane sulfur, i.e. thiol groups, or other acidic groups on the polymer. One oxirane resin (PYROH) was tested as a reference compound to detect the presence of other acidic groups on the resin. The resins IMSH and TETSH were also tested for their SH content with the titration procedure after they had been shaken for 24 h with 1.0 M HZS04 followed by washing with demineralized water until neutral. This experiment was performed to determine if oxidation of the SH groups takes place during regeneration of the resins with dilute mineral acid. 2.4. Batch metal-uptake experiments The batch metal-uptake experiments were performed using standard metal chloride solutions of 0.16 and 0.6 M buffer solutions NaCI/HCl (pH 0.9-2.3) and NaOAc/HOAc (pH 2.5-6.0). All experiments were performed in polyethylene bottles mounted on a shaker at 25. The capacities for Cue+, Nit+, Zn2+ and Cdz+ under non-competitive conditions were de- 18 PM. van Berkel et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 15-28 termined as a function of the pH. Batches of 0.2 g resin were used, together with a mixture of 25 ml of metal solution and 25 ml of buffer. After a shaking time of 48 h, the samples were filtered, washed respectively with water, ethanol and ether, and dried in vacuo at 50. For the determination of the Cu 2+ capacities at pH >5 a lower Cu 2+ concentration (10 ml of the standard Cuz+ solution and 40 ml of buffer) was used to prevent precipitation of Cu(II) hydroxides. Batch metal-uptake experiments under competitive conditions were performed with standard metal chloride solutions of Cu Z+, Niz+, Cot+, Zn Z+ and Cd2+ in a pH range from 0.9 to 6. Batches of 0.2 g resin were used together with a mixture of 5 ml of each metal solution and 25 ml of buffer. After a shaking time of 48 h, the samples were further handled as described for the non-competitive experiments. In the regeneration experiments, H2S04 (1.0 M) was tested for its stripping potential. Batches of the ion-exchange materials (each 1.0 g) were loaded with a CUC12 or a ZnC12 solution (25 ml of the metal standard solution and 25 ml of HOAc/NaOAc buffer) at pH 4.4-4.5 by shaking for a period of 48 h. The loaded samples were stripped with a 1.0 M H2S04 solution (shaking time 48 h). This procedure was repeated 5 times with fresh solutions. Samples for metal analyses were prepared by heating 0.1 g of the loaded samples with concentrated HZSOq and subsequently with concentrated HN03 until clear solutions were obtained. The metal contents of these solutions were measured by AAS spectroscopy using a non-linear calibration curve. 2.5. Spectroscopic characterization of the loaded resins To obtain information about the coordination environment of the metal ions when bound to the resin, electronic spectra in the visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) and EPR spectra of several loaded resins were recorded. Batches of about 0.2 g were treated with aqueous solutions of CUC12 and NiC12 as described for the capacity experiments. Dried Cue+-loaded samples were used for EPR spectroscopy at room temperature and at 77 K. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Synthetic aspects The B.E.T surface areas of the starting polymers p(GMA-O) and p(GMA-S) were 55 and 73 M2 /g, respectively. The degree of conversion from oxirane to thiirane was 84%. The presence of oxirane groups which are still intact on p(GMA-S) can be ruled out considering the reaction conditions in which this conversion took place [10]. The ligand concentrations of the modified p(GMA-O) and p(GMA-S) resins, determined by elemental analysis, are given in Table 1. The higher concentration of SH groups compared to the ligand concentrations on the thiirane resins is most probably caused by inaccessibility problems, i.e. not all thiirane groups on the polymer will be accessible for the azole ligands during the immobilization reaction in toluene. Subsequent stirring for 6 h with water followed by additional purification by Soxhlet extraction with 1,4-dioxane (24 h) and ethanol (10 h) [10], causes hydrolysis of the unreacted thiirane groups. The results of the quantitative determination of the amount of SH groups in the 4 thiirane resins are summarized in Table 2. The SH contents for the different resins determined via the titration method are much more in agreement with SH contents calculated from elemental analysis data than with the data obtained via the Ellman procedure, although there is still a rather large discrepancy. This can be understood in terms of accessibility, i.e. not all SH groups will be accessible for the reagents, and also some SH groups, may, in the course of all the treatments, be oxidized to disulfides, sulfines or sulfonic acid groups. Ellman reagent seems to react only with the SH groups which are on the surface or very near to the surface of the PM. van Berkel et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 15-28 Table 1 Ligand concentration, SH concentration and conversion of oxirane and thiirane groups on the oxirane and thiirane resins Resin Type of ligand Ligand concentration (mmol/g) 19 SH concentration Conversion of oxirane/thiirane (mmol/g) (%) PYROH Pyrazole 2.3 - 72 IMOH Imidazole 2.1 - 66 TRIOH 1,2,4-Triazole 2.2 - 69 TETOH Tetrazole 2.5 - 78 PYRSH Pyrazole 1.1 1.7 50 IMSH Imidazole 1.3 1.9 59 TRISH 1,2,4-Triazole 1.2 1.9 55 TETSH Tetrazole 1.1 1.5 50 As calculated from elemental analysis data (C, H, N, S, O) [10].

SH groups (mmol/g) (elemental analysis) resin particles. This is most probably ascribable to hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions of the reagent and the resin. The unmodified p(GMAS) polymer did not show the presence of any thiol or other acidic groups in the acid-base back titration. The resin PYROH which served as a blank in the acid-base back titration did not show the presence of any acidic groups. The resins IMSH and TETSH, which were first shaken for 24 h in 1.0 M H2SOq before being titrated, show no significant loss of SH groups due to oxidation (<5%). The CP MAS 13C-NMR spectra of p(GMAS) (A) and p(GMA-O) (B) are presented in Fig. 1. Characteristic thiirane peaks are seen at 30.5 and 38.3 ppm, a characteristic oxirane peak can be seen at 48.0 ppm. The CP MAS 13CNMR spectra of the modified p(GMA-O) and p(GMA-S) clearly show the addition of the different azole ligands to the oxirane or thiirane ring. The characteristic peaks for the oxirane and thiirane groups disappear and additional lig- and peaks, pyrazole C3 (139.6); C4 (108.0); C5 (131.9), imidazole C2 (138.6); C4 (129.0); C5 (122.0), 1,2,4-triazole C3 (152.0); C5 (145.0) and tetrazole C4/5 (144.9 and 153.0) (ppm) are observed [19,20]. There are hardly any differences between the spectra of the modified oxirane and thiirane resins. In the spectra of TETOH and TETSH, both tautomeric forms of the tetrazole ligand are visible. In Fig. 2 the 13C CP MASNMR spectra of PYRSH (A) and PYROH (B) are shown. FT-IR spectra of the modified resins did not show any substantial difference between the oxirane and thiirane resins, i.e. OH groups versus SH groups. The epoxy peaks and thiirane peaks, found in the spectra of p(GMA-O) and p(GMAS) respectively, at 850, 910 (epoxy ring vibration), 1340, 1480 (8(CH)epoxy) [21], 620, 910 (thiirane ring vibration), 1330 and 1440 cm-1 (8(CH)thiirane), have disappeared completely from the spectra of the modified p(GMA-O) and p(GMA-S) resins.

Peaks originating from the oxirane ring are marked O and peaks originating from the thiirane ring are marked T erocyclic aromatic ring vibrations are observed between 1500 and 1600 cm-1 in the spectra of the modified oxirane and thiirane resins [22]. The thiol group has a typical stretching vibration at 2550 cm-1 [18]; however, this vibration could not be detected in the FT-IR spectra of the modified p(GMA-S) resins. This is most probably due to the relatively low thiol concentration on the polymer beads together with the low extinction coefficient of this vibration. Spectra recorded in the 700-200 cm-' region, where other sulfurcontaining groups have their specific frequencies, did not give any additional information. Raman spectroscopy was applied, but unfortunately the resins were unstable in the laser beam. The Cl to Zn molar ratios of a number of Zn(II)-loaded resins are listed in Table 3. For all thiirane resins these molar ratios most probably imply that besides chloride other anions, such as acetate are present in the resins, especially in the case of IMSH. Whether the coordinating SH groups in the resins are dehydronated 1 or not, could not be deduced from the data available. For the resin PYROH, the Cl- to Zn2+ ratio is clearly larger than 2.0. The relatively large amount of Cl- in this Zn(II)-loaded resin suggests that Cl- can also be bound to the resin in a different way, e.g. as HCI. 3.2. Batch metal-uptake experiments The metal-ion uptake capacities of the oxirane and thiirane resins were determined under non-competitive and competitive conditions as a function of pH. Because all resins tested have different ligand concentrations (see Table 1), it would not be correct to compare the capacity data (C in mmol/g) of the different resins. 1 (De)hydronated is the official IUPAC expression for (de)protonated.

The definition for the ligand occupation is given in Eq. 1. Ligand occupation (L in %) x 100 uptake capacity (C) for MZ+ (in mmol/g) ligand concentration (in mmol/g) The Cuz+-uptake and the Niz+-uptake patterns for the oxirane and thiirane resins under non-competitive conditions are given in Fig. 3. The metal-uptake patterns for the different oxirane resins, given in Fig. 3A and B, show that for both CuZ+ and Ni2+ the resin PYROH has a very high ligand occupation at pH > 4.5 compared to the other oxirane resins. However, the thiirane resins (Fig. 3C, D) show high Cu z+uptake capacities for all 4 thiirane resins, with the imidazole resin somewhat lagging behind. The same pattern is seen for Niz+, only with a relatively lower ligand occupation. The formation of a very stable chelate structure with an azole nitrogen and the pendant thiol group in the different thiirane resins is most probably the reason for this uptake behavior. This is also confirmed by the fact that IMSH does not keep up with the other thiirane resins, because the imidazole group present does not have a coordinating nitrogen atom a to the ring, to form a proper chelate. Formation of a similar chelate structure in the oxirane resins is of course possible, but looking at the metaluptake patterns, this does not appear to be so with IMOH, TRIOH and TETOH. The poorer 22 PM. van Berkel et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 15-28 100 80 80 40 20 0 100 8 60 40 20 0 L (%) resin - SHIMOH s SHPYROH SHTRIOH ~SHTETOH 100 a0 80 40 20 0 6 0 resin SHIMOH ~SHPYROH 't SHTRIOH ~ SHTETOH 1 2 3 4 pH 5 100 resin resin 'SHIMSH C -SHIMSH `>SHPYRSH 80- aSHPYRSH ~SHTRISH 't SHTRISH SHTETSH ~SHTETSH 80 40 20 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 pH pH 6 6 Fig. 3.

For IMOH the formation of a chelate structure is impeded for the same reasons as for the thiirane analogue, and this effect is strengthened by the weaker coordinating ability of the hydroxyl group. For both TRIOH and TETOH the weaker monodentate coordinating abilities of the azole ligands towards metal ions compared to those of imidazole and pyrazole ligands, are amplified by the weaker coordinating properties of the hydroxyl group. This is especially noticeable for the tetrazole-containing resin. This hardly takes up any metal ions at all. Instability of the tetrazole resin under the given PM. van Berkel et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 15-28 testing conditions can be ruled out. Elemental analysis of the loaded TETOH resins confirmed a ligand concentration of 2.5 mmol tetrazole/g, which is the same as the ligand concentration of the unloaded resin. Formation of disulfide bridges in the thiirane resins, thereby bringing two azole ligands closer together and giving them the opportunity to form a chelate structure, can most probably be ruled out. The results with the SH-titration method suggests that no or hardly any disulfide bridges formed. The metal-uptake patterns for Cue+, Nit+, Znz+ and Cdz+ with PYROH and PYRSH determined under non-competitive conditions are shown in Fig. 4. There is a considerable Cdz+ and ZnZ+ capacity for PYRSH at a pH >4, whereas the resin PYROH hardly takes up any Zn2+ or Cdz+ ions at all. This is also a strong indication that the SH group plays a major role in the coordination of the metal ions on the polymer. It is generally known that ZnZ+ ions prefer to coordinate to sulfides and hardly coordinate to thioether and disulfide groups. Metal-uptake experiments under non-competitive conditions of IMSH, TRISH and TETSH for the metal ions Cue+, NiZ+, Znz+ and Cd2+ (see Fig. 5) confirm that the the SH group must be strongly involved in the coordination of the metal ions on the thiirane resins. The competitive experiments with the oxirane resins and the metal ions Cu Z+, Nit+, Coz+, Zn2+ and Cd2+, presented in Fig. 6, show that PYROH, IMOH and TRIOH are all very selective for Cu(II). The other metal ions are hardly taken up at all by these resins, the maximum ligand occupation for these metal ions being ^-2.5%. The tetrazole containing resin TETOH does not show any tendency to take up any metal ions at all. This is consistent with the metal-ion uptake pattern of TETOH under noncompetitive conditions. The results of competitive experiments with the thiirane resins and the metal ions Cue+, Nit+, Cot+, Znz+ and CdZ+ are given in Fig. 7. Except for PYRSH, all 3 resins are very selective for Cu(II).

The tetrazole resin is the only resin which shows such an enormous difference in uptake behavior between the SH analogue and OH analogue. This is, as mentioned earlier, most probably due to a combination of two fac- tors, i.e. the better coordinating properties of the thiol groups compared to hydroxyl groups, and the inability of tetrazole ligands to form strong coordination complexes. The formation of a stable chelate structure in TETSH, which is less likely in TETOH, most probably causes the large difference in metal-ion binding affinity between these two resins.

Both resins show no significant decrease in metal-uptake capacity for Cu 2+ and Zn2+. As 25 observed previously, no significant oxidation of thiol groups occurs after treatment with dilute acid. It can also be concluded that 1.0 M HZS04 is a good stripping agent, i.e. less than 0.04 mmol MZ+/g is left on the resin after a stripping cycle. 26 PM. van Berkel et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 15-28 L(%) 100 M - Cu 80 - Ni ~ Co t Cd 60 -Zn 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20- 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 pH M= -Cu -Ni ~Co r' Cd -Zn 0 1 2 3 4 pH 5 100 80 60 40 20 0 M' -Cu -Ni -x- Co -*- Cd -Zn 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 pH 100 80 60 40 20 0 6 Mw -Cu Ni -\"- Co Cd Zn 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 pH Fig. 7.

Spectroscopic data of the loaded resins Ligand field and EPR data of several M2+loaded oxirane and thiirane resins are given in Table 5. The maximum concentration of Cuz+ and Ni2+ on TETOH was found to be low, i.e. <0.04 mmol/g, to obtain reasonable ligand field spectra. No ligand field spectra could be taken of IMSH because of its dark-brown color. Ligand field spectra of the resins loaded with Ni2+ show electronic absorption bands which can be ascribed to a distorted octahedral coordination environment around the Ni2+ ion [23]. Ligand field spectra of the resins loaded with Cu 2+ show one d-d transition, which for the oxirane resins appears at approximately 13 x 103 cm-1, and PM. van Berkel et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 15-28 27 Table 4 Metal-uptake capacity (C in mmol/g) of IMSH and TRISH after consecutive loading (Cu2+ or Zn2+) and stripping (1.0 M HZSOa) Cycle Type IMSH/Cuz+ IMSH/Zn'+ TRISH/Cu'-+ TRISH/Zn2+ 1 Loaded 0.39 0.20 0.61 0.40 Stripped 0.01 <0.01 0.03 <0.01 2 Loaded 0.39 0.19 0.60 0.38 Stripped 0.01 <0.01 0.03 <0.01 3 Loaded 0.34 0.21 0.52 0.27 Stripped <0.01 <0.01 0.02 <0.01 4 Loaded 0.34 0.22 0.56 0.30 Stripped <0.01 <0.01 0.01 <0.01 5 Loaded 0.36 0.21 0.55 0.35 Stripped <0.01 <0.01 0.01 <0.01 Table 5 Colors, ligand field and EPR data of several M2+-loaded oxirane and thiirane resins Sample pH MZ+ Color Electronic bands EPR\" (101 cm-,) g values (g1, g//) PYROH 5.7 Ni Light green 9.1, 14.7, 24.4 IMOH 5.5 Ni Light green 9.7, 15.3, 26.0 PYROH 5.8 Cu Light blue 13.1 2.07, 2.33 IMOH 5.8 Cu Light blue 13.4 2.07, 2.27 TRIOH 5.8 Cu Light blue-green 13.5 2.08, 2.28 TRISH 5.4 Ni Light green 8.4, 15.0, 25.4 TETSH 5.4 Ni Light green 8.7, 14.8, 24.8 PYRSH 5.7 Cu Gray-green 10.9 2.07, 2.34 IMSH 5.7 Cu Dark brown - 2.07, 2.29 TRISH 5.7 Cu Light blue-green 10.6 2.08, 2.30 TETSH 5.7 Cu Gray-green 10.5 2.08, 2.34 The spectra were taken at room temperature. for the thiirane resins around 10 x 103 cm-1. The lower d-d transition for the thiirane resins might indicate coordination by the sulfide group, while for the oxirane resins another donor is involved, either water, acetate, ROH or chloride. The EPR spectra all show an axial signal. The g1l and g values for the oxirane and thiirane resins are almost identical. There were no differences between the spectra taken at room temperature and at 77 K. Whether the Cu 2+ complexes on the oxirane resins compared to the complexes on the thiirane resins have a total different coordination geometry or only different donor atoms, could not be deduced from the available ligand field and EPR data. 4. Conclusions The present investigation has shown that the oxirane and the thiirane-based resins are both selective for Cu z+ ions at pH >2.5 in the presence of other divalent heavy metal ions. However, the thiirane resin PYRSH also takes up considerable amounts of CdZ+ and ZnZ+ ions, while the other azole thiirane resins bind less Zn2+. The uptake of Znz+ and Cd'+ can be ascribed to the presence of thiol groups in the thiirane resins, which are known to be very good donor atoms for these types of metal ions. The PYRSH resin would therefore be a good candidate not only for Cue+, but also for the removal of Znz+ 28 PM. van Berkel et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 15-28 and Cd2+ from waste-water streams. For selective removal of Cu 2+ ions, the resin PYROH could be very appropriate. Comparison of the oxirane and thiirane resins also shows that the thiol group plays a major role in the formation of chelate structures with the pendant azole ring. Due to the formation of these stable chelate structures the maximum ligand occupation for the metal ions tested with the thiirane resins increases noticeably. This was especially true for the tetrazole-containing thiirane resin (TETSH). The maximum ligand occupation for Cu z+ increased from less than 0.4 to 78.6%. The fact that tetrazoles are weak coordinating ligands is compensated by the presence of the pendant thiol group. Of all four azole ligands presented in this paper, the pyrazole ligand has the best Cu e+uptake affinity for both the oxirane and thiirane polymers. The maximum ligand occupation of Cuz+ for the resins PYROH and PYRSH are 98.3 and 88.6%, respectively. The 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole ligands have weaker coordinating properties, therefore they are more dependent on the nature of the pendant group, i.e. -OH versus -SH. The imidazole ligand lacks an anitrogen atom and is therefore not capable of forming chelate structures in both p(GMA-O) and p(GMA-S). The M2+ -uptake patterns of the 8 resins tested al] show very steep uptake curves, i.e. the M2+-uptake increases rapidly with increasing pH. With this type of behavior it is possible to regenerate the resins at a higher pH, thereby limiting the amount of mineral acid needed. Acknowledgement Mr. C. Erkelens and Mr. J.G.

The azole ligands pyrazole, imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole and tetrazole have been immobilized onto poly(glycidyl methacrylate) p(GMA-O) and onto its sulfur analogue p(GMA-S), which contains a thiirane ring instead of an oxirane ring. The ligands were introduced using ring-opening reactions of the pendant oxirane or thiirane groups with the azoles, resulting in formation of the chelating ion-exchange resins PYROH, IMOH, TRIOH, TETOH, PYRSH, IMSH, TRISH and TETSH. The resins have been characterized by solid-state 13C cross-polarization and magic-angle spinning NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Batch extraction capacities were determined for the chloride salts of Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ in buffered solutions in the pH range 0.9\u20136.0. Both modified oxirane and thiirane resins are very selective for Cu2+ in the presence of other divalent heavy metal ions. The maximum uptake capacities for Cu2+ for the oxirane resins under non-competitive conditions are 0.28 mmol/g for TRIOH, 0.39 mmol/g for IMOH and 1.14 mmol/g for PYROH. The resin TETOH is an exception, and does not show any detectable uptake of M2+ at all. The maximum uptake capacities for Cu2+ for the thiirane resins under non-competitive conditions are 0.87 mmol/g for TETSH, 0.96 mmol/g for TRISH, 0.58 mmol/g for IMSH and 0.98 mmol/g for PYRSH. The 4 thiirane resins also sorb noticeable amounts of Cd2+ and Zn2+ especially the resin PYRSH. The maximum uptakes of Cd2+ and Zn2+ for PYRSH are 0.65 and 0.74 mmol/g respectively. The complexation of Cd2+ and Zn2+ by the thiirane is ascribed to the presence of thiol groups. The resins PYROH and PYRSH have the highest uptake capacity for Cu2+ of all the resins tested. The M2+-uptake sorption behavior of all the 8 resins show very steep pH-dependent curves, i.e. virtually no M2+-uptake below pH 2.5 and, depending on the particular metal ion, maximum uptake at pH 5.5. The thiirane resins are stable in the presence of dilute mineral acid, as was shown by regeneration experiments performed with 1.0 M H2SO4.
