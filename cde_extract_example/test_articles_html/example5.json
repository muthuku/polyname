Ogala Department of Chemistry, Sophia University, 7-1 Kioi-Cho, Chiyoda-Ku, Tokyo 102, Japan Accepted 13 January 1995 Abstract Poly(L-glutamate) with amphiphilic side chains was designed as a membrane material for optical resolution of a-amino acids. Solvent-cast films of the poly (L-glutamate) had a self-ordered structure containing a-helix of the poly(L-glutamate). Optical resolutions of various amino acids were carried out through the thin membranes of the amphiphilic poly(L-glutamate). Racemic mixtures of tryptophan were completely separated through the membrane. Mechanism of the optical resolutions was investigated in terms of molecular recognition of racemic tryptophan by the ordered structure of the membrane. Keywords: Optical resolution; Poly(L-glutamate); Membrane; a-Amino acid 1. Introduction Membrane separation processes have marked advantages in industrial applications because of the ease of handing, instrumental simplicity and efficiency in energy as compared to chromatographic separation process. However, an ideal membrane which can separate optical isomers has not yet appeared, except in a form of liquid membrane. Normally, optical isomers have the same chemical and physical properties so that the separation of these optical isomers is very difficult by conventional separation methods such as distillation or recrystallization. The permeation of substrates through a membrane is determined by partitioning behaviors of the permeating substrate with respect to the membrane and by their diffusibilities or mobil- 1381-5148/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved. SSDI 1381-5148(95)00007-0 ities in the membrane. However, the complete optical resolution requires another factor, that is, molecular recognition which can distinguish one isomer from another. Thus, in order to improve the enantioselectivity of the membrane, considerable effort should be made to optimize the combination of these factors. Poly(a-amino acid)s are known to form a stable helical structure which is either right- or left-hand helicoid based on enantiometric structures of a-amino acids. It is strongly expected that the helical structure of poly(a-amino acid)s may have a good enantioselectivity owing to some stereospecificinteractions. According to this concept, poly(L-glutamate) derivatives having amphiphilic side chains of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups were designed as membrane materials. The following structure was selected for the membrane materials [l]: 202 ~COCHNH~-,- I (CH2)2 COOJCH2CHz0 m O C9Hi9 NON6-PLG It is expected that NON-6-PLG may form a self-organized structure by solvent-casting, as shown below: Hydrophilic chains Hydrophobic chains Permeations of water-soluble optical isomers such as a-amino acids may take place through the hydrophilic domains where chiral interactions may occur with the helix of PLG, leading to the optical resolution through the NON-6-PLG membrane. 2. Synthesis and characterization of NON-6-PLG membrane Poly(y-methyl-L-glutamate) (PMLG), with a molecular weight of 100,000 Da, was used as 4CONH~ + (CHa)a C00 CH3 PMLG P75 -f COCHNH~-n in EDC (CH2)7 N.

NON-6-PLG showed strong CD spectra owing to the phenoxy group and absorption peaks of the phenoxy group decreased with increasing temperatures as indicated in Fig. 1. The CD signal of the phenoxy group disappeared at 50 in a dry state, which is the glass transition temperature of NON-6-PLG, while it remained at above 70 in a wet state, as shown in Fig. 2. NON-6-PLG showed cholesteric textures under cross-polarized microscope as shown in Fig. 3. X-ray analyses of NON-6-PLG indicated the ordered structure of NON-6-PLG after solventcasting and the structure can be illustrated as shown in Fig. 4. Hydrated state of the membrane stabilized the ordered structure above and Tg this stabilization favors the permeation in water. The distance among the helices of NON-6PLG was determined by X-ray analysis as shown in Fig. 5. N.

Optical resolutions by NON-6-PLG membrane As NON-6-PLG did not offer self-standing membrane because of low Tg, an anisotropic ultrafilter was used as a membrane support and an EDC solution of NON-6-PLG was placed on the dense side of the ultrafilter and was dried under a nitrogen atmosphere. A disproportionate two-chambered cell whose chamber volumes on the donor and acceptor sides were 11 and 4 cm 3, was used for permeation experiments. 203 Fig. 3.

Permeation behaviors of a-amino acids through the NON-6-PLG membrane are shown in Figs. 6 and 7, which indicate the permeation of tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp), respectively. It can be seen in these figures that the NON6-PLG membrane preferentially permeated Disomers for Tyr and a complete optical resolution of Trp was attained. In other words, only Disomer of Trp could permeate and no permeation occurred for L-Trp. 204 ~E 4 E n ~O 3 v v 4' a 2 E L v a N.

Casting conditions greatly influenced the ordered structure of NON-6-PLG, as can be seen in different CD spectra after casting, as shown in Fig. 8. However, annealing of the NON-6-PLG membrane in warm water at 65 for 3 days was very effective in maintaining the same ordered structure, as can be seen in Fig. 8. The restructuring of the ordered structure of NON-6-PLG is very important for the optical resolution. Fig. 9 indicates that no permeation took place for both D- and L-Trp, while good optical resolution was attained after annealing. The restructuring could be attained not only by annealing, but also by salt treatment, such as NaCI.

Preferential permeation of D-Ser took place in comparison with L-Ser. However, no significant optical resolutions for alanine or phenylalanine were attained by this membrane. Perhaps, a strong hydrogen-bonding between the NON-6-membrane and substrates is required for the optical resolution. When an aqueous solution of a-amino acids is kept under air, bacteria in air may be included and the bacteria may consume L-isomers. As a result, the permeation behaviors may lead to a wrong conclusion, owing to the contamination of bacteria in the solution. Therefore, several antibacterial agents were added in the aqueous solutions during the permeation. Chloramphenicol and sodium azide were added to the solution so that they might stop the bacterial activity. Results of the permeations N.

Additions of these antibacterial agents slightly accelerated the permeation of L-Trp. However, since the CD spectra of the NON-6-PLG membrane changed by the addition of these antibacteria agents, it is presumed that the permeation change might be ascribed to the structural change of the membrane. From these results, as mentioned above, the NON-6-PLG membrane can achieve effective optical resolution through the thin membrane. 4.

Adsorption behaviors can also be analyzed by a quartz microbalance which can detect a weight change of 1 ng. Therefore, the head of a quartz crystal microbalance was immersed into an EDC solution of NON-6-PLG so that it was coated by NON-6-PLG. The coated head was immersed in an aqueous solution of either Lor D-Trp. The weight change of NON-6-PLG by adsorption of Trp can be detected as changes of resonant frequency, which are shown in Fig. 15. The time to reach an equilibrium of adsorption of Trp which is indicated as B was much longer in L-Trp than in D-Trp, as can be seen in Table 1.

Spectroscopic analyses The adsorption place in NON-6-PLG was analyzed by emission fluorescence spectrum which is shown in Fig. 16. D-Trp had a strong peak at 353 nm in water, which was shifted to 330 nm in NON-6-PLG. The same shift occurred in diethylene glycol dimethylether. On the other hand, no shift of the peak occurred in benzene or n-heptane. These results strongly suggested that D-Trp was strongly adsorbed in the oxyethylene segments of NON-6-PLG (see Scheme 2). Adsorption behaviors of Trp into NON-6PLG can be analyzed by FT-IR, as shown in Fig. 17. It can be seen in Fig. 17 that D-Trp was much more incorporated in NON-6-PLG than L-Trp.

Conclusion Scheme 2 NON-6-PLG, which has a well-ordered self organized structure of helix and amphiphilic side chains, could separate optical isomers of a-amino acids through thin membranes. The optical resolution of NON-6-PLG could be as cribed to molecular recognition of isomers by I a chiral interaction of helical structure of poly 4000 (L-glutamate), possible owing to a strong hy drogen bonding between the helix and amino acids.
