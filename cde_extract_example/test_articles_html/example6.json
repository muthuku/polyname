TC.E., University Jaume I, E-12080 Castell, Spain Received XX; Accepted XX Abstract The preparation of functionalized polystyrene-divinylbenzene resins containing functional groups bonded to the polymeric matrix by a long alkyl chain has been accomplished in a two-step procedure from unfunctionalized resins and the acid chloride of a monoalkyl ester of an alkanedioic acid. The procedure is useful for the preparation of spacer-modified polymers of variable crosslinking degrees, including highly crosslinked macroreticular resins such as XAD-4. The high mobility of the chains is revealed by the easy analysis of the polymers by gel-phase 13C-NMR spectroscopy. Keywords: Polymer-supported reagents; Polystyrene-divinylbenzene; Spacer-modified polystyrene 1. Introduction The most common starting materials for the preparation of polymer-supported reagents or catalysts continue to be chloromethylated polystyrene resins [1-3]. The easy chloromethylation of polystyrene copolymers [4-6] as well as the high reactivity of the resulting benzylic positions allow the simple introduction of a large number of functional groups and explain the widespread use of these polymers [7]. However, two main disadvantages are- often found in the use of chloromethylated resins. First of all, the formation of benzylic bonds that can be unstable under the conditions needed for further transformations and can give place to undesired * Corresponding author. 1381-5148/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved. SSDI1381-5148(95)00008-9 reactions [8,9]. On the other hand, direct attachment to the polymeric backbone through a methylene spacer reduces the mobility of the functional group introduced and, in some cases, makes their accessibility to reagents, substrates and solvents difficult. This drawback is further increased if we consider that chloromethylation of polystyrene or polystyrene-divinylbenzene resins is often accompanied by additional crosslinking of the polymer chains [10]. This situation can lead to a decrease in the activity of polymerbound reagents and catalysts when compared with their soluble counterparts. In some instances, a clear improvement of the activity of polymer-supported species has been obtained when the active site is separated from the polymeric backbone through an appropriated spacer chain, (see, for instance, Refs. [11-19]). 76 S. V Luis et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 75-83 Accordingly, much effort has been devoted to the preparation of resins functionalized through different spacers [11-29]. Functionalization of polystyrene polymers through dimethylene spacers has been studied in detail [13,26,27] and a number of resins containing longer spacers have been described for different applications. In general, spacers longer than dimethylene contain additional functional groups (ester, amide, ether, amino, etc.) which may interfere for some catalytic applications. From the different approaches to the preparation of polymers modified through long aliphatic spacers [15,17,18,27], the most general and wider application seems to be the one devised by Tomoi via alkylation of polystyrene resins with o)-bromoalkenes in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. However, the method is limited to the preparation of spacer-modified polymers containing low degrees (0-4%) of crosslinking. Here we report on a different approach to prepare such spacer-modified resins from readily available starting materials. This novel method is applicable to microreticular as well as to macroreticular polymers. 2. Results and discussion The general procedure developed for the preparation of functionalized polymers containing long aliphatic spacers is outlined in Scheme 1. The key step for this procedure is the preparation of polymeric keto ester 2. Functionalization of crosslinked polystyrenes to afford intermediate 2 could be accomplished in excellent yields by reaction with the chloride of a monoalkyl ester of an alkanedioic acid in CSZ in the presence of AIC13, in conditions similar to those described for related acylation reactions [22,30,31]. After thorough washing to free the polymer from any residual amount of AIC13 [31] the polymers showed in the IR spectra the presence of two distinct carbonyl bands at 1678 and 1733 cm-1 corresponding to the keto and the ester functional groups. The degree of functionalization of the resulting resins was determined by conversion into the corresponding polymeric oximes 4 or thioketals 5, and elemental analysis for nitrogen or sulfur. Both reactions were easily monitored through the disappearance of the C=O carbonyl band corresponding to the keto group. Thioketal formation seems to be a more reliable procedure, as results derived from oxime derivatives were affected by conditions used for the derivatization reaction. Thus, for instance, when derivatization was carried out in a mixture of EtOH, dioxane and water in the presence of NaOH [31], oxime formation was accompanied by reaction of the ester group to give a hydroxamic acid [32] as observed in the IR by a decrease in the intensity of the C=O ester band and the appearance of a novel band at 1568 cm-1 for the salt of the hydroxamic acid. However, when pyridine was used as the base and the solvent [33] results were, in general, in good agreement with those found through thioketal formation. Quantitative transformation of 2 into 5 was accomplished by reaction of 2 with an excess of ethanedithiol in the presence of BF3 as the catalyst. Results obtained for functionalization of polystyrene resins of variable crosslinking degrees, according to Scheme 1, to give polymers 2 are summarized in Table 1. It can be observed that resins with loadings in the range of 0.52.2 mEq/g (DF ~ 0.05-0.35) can be easily ob- P O p O O P o OR Scheme 1. S.

It has to be noted that a loading of ca. 2 mEq/g represents that 31% of the weight of polymer 2 corresponds to the weight of the functional group introduced when the monoester of the adipic acid is used. An excess of catalyst over the alkanedioic acid derivative seems to be needed to obtain good yields for the anchoring of the keto ester moiety. For microreticular resins containing 1 or 2% DV13 as well as for the XE-305 resin, reaction was essentially complete after stirring at room temperature for a period of ca. 24 h. After this time, more than 90% of the reagent added had been bound to the resins. In general, once the acid chloride is consumed, an increase in the reaction time is not advisable, as a slow crosslinking process can take place, in the presence of the excess of catalyst, by an additional Friedel-Crafts reaction of the ester groups of the spacers. For macroreticular resins such as XAD-2 and XAD-4 [34] functionalization was limited to loadings be- 78 S. V Luis et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 75-83 low 1 mEq/g, but degrees of functionalization in the range of 0.5-1.0 mEq/g were easily achieved in the same conditions used for microreticular polymers. This limitation is usually found in the work with highly crosslinked polystyrenes. In both cases, degrees of functionalization could be controlled in a simple way by the amount of acid chloride or catalyst added and reaction time. When adipic acid reagent was changed for the acid chloride derived from the monomethyl ester of azelaic acid very similar results were obtained, but a slight decrease in the functionalization of the resins was usually observed. Transformation of polymer-bound keto esters 2 into resins of general structure 3 requires conversion of the keto functionality into a methylene group. Different reagents have been described to carry out such a transformation, but many of them are used under very drastic conditions which are non-compatible with the polymeric nature of 2. In our hands, best results were obtained when reduction of the keto group to methylene was accomplished through initial formation of tosylhydrazone 6. This transformation was quantitatively achieved by reaction of 2 with an excess of tosylhydrazine in EtOH [35,36]. The IR spectra of the resulting polymers 6 showed the presence of a unique carbonyl band corresponding to the ester fragment. Both LiAlH4 and catecholborane have been described for the conversion of tosylhydrazones to methylene groups. Reaction of 6 with catechol-borane reagent in chloroform [35,36] afforded ester 7 anchored to the 0 0 NHTk fu< 74< 0 R 2 2 R = CH2CH3 :==5 R=CH3 polymeric backbone by an spacer containing 5 or 8 methylene groups. When LLAAH4 in THF was used [37], IR spectra of the resulting resins showed the absence of the carbonyl band characteristic of the ester group, revealing transformation of 6 into polymer-supported alcohol 8. In general, it was observed that difficulties to obtain complete reduction of functional groups in 6 increase with functionalization degrees of starting polymers 2. The high mobility of the spacer is clearly revealed by the \"C gel phase NMR spectra of the polymers [10,38-41]. Satisfactory gel-phase 13 C-NMR spectra were usually obtained from samples swollen in CDC13 and made homogeneous by ultrasonical stirring, even with the use of a 5-mm probe at 50.5 MHz. All spectra showed the signals characteristic of the polymeric backbone centered at 40-45, 125-130 and 145 ppm. Besides those signals, 13C-NMR spectra of keto esters derived from adipic acid (2, n = 2, R=CH2CH3) contained additional sharp singlets in the aliphatic region at 14.3, 23.6, 24.6, 34.2, 40.4 and 60.3 ppm, in good agreement with the expected chemical shifts for the structural subunit present in 2 (n = 2, R=CH2CH3). For keto esters 2 derived from azelaic acid (2, n = 5, R=CH3), sharp signals at 24.3, 24.8, 29.1, 34.0, 40.4 and 51.4 ppm were observed. Three carbon atoms are predicted to have coincident chemical shifts in the 29-30 ppm. region and accordingly the signal at 29.1 ppm is much stronger than other signals.

It must be emphasized that satisfactory NMR spectra were obtained even for polymers containing a moderate degree of crosslinking such as XE-305. Unsatisfactory results were, however, obtained for resins with a higher content in DVB (XAD-2 or XAD-4).

A semi-quantitative measurement of the mobility of the chains can be assessed through the measurement of the line widths at half heights of different signals [10,38-40]. Table 2 shows some selected values which confirm the high mobility of the chains introduced on the polymers. Thus, for instance, line widths of ca. 11-16 Hz Table 2 isC line widths at half height (Hz) for polymers 2 (n = 2, R= Et) at 50.3 Hz in CDC13 a Starting resin Cl C2 C3 C4 CS C66 1% DVB 11 16 23 21 22 35 2% DVB 19 29 30 -` -` 38 XE-305 18 27 28 27 29 35 a Numbering corresponds to Fig. 1. b This peak appears overlapped with the backbone methine carbon signal. Accordingly, this LW should be related to the mobility of the polymeric matrix. ` Overlapping of C4 and CS signals does not allow an accurate measurement of the line widths. 80 S. V Luis et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 75-83 were measured for the ethyl group signals in polymer 2 (n = 2, R=CHZCH3) from 1% crosslinked polystyrene, while line widths of 20-24 Hz were found for methylenic carbon atoms in the chain. For signals corresponding to the polymeric matrix, line widths higher than 30 Hz were usually found [10,38]. As observed in Table 2, for the same carbon atoms, line widths increase when crosslinking changes from 1 to 2%, but no additional increase is observed when changing from 2% crosslinked polymer to XE-305 resin. For resin 2 derived from azelaic acid (n = 5, R=CH3), measurement of the line widths is more difficult because of the presence of a large number of overlapping signals, but values obtained for non-overlapping peaks agree well with values for related carbon atoms in polymers derived from adipic acid. Thus, for instance, a LW of 19 Hz was obtained for signals of the methyl group in the resin prepared from 1% crosslinked polystyrene, a value which compares well with the 16 Hz value shown for C2 in Table 2 for a related polymer. A similar concordance was found between the value of 22 Hz measured for the peak at 34 ppm, corresponding to the methylene next to the ester group, and values in Table 2 for methylenic carbons of the 1% crosslinked resin. Finally, conversion of polymers 7 and 8 into different polymer-bound functionalities was assayed. Preliminary results showed that, in gen- (i?r>ZNH TSCI o OH RCOOH H+ OCOR 10 eral, transformation of 7 and 8 can be carried out under similar conditions to those described for resins containing dimethylene spacers [26,27]. Thus, polymeric alcohol 8 (Scheme 4) could be tosylated using p-toluenesulfonyl chloride and a stoichiometric amount of diisopropylamine, under the conditions described by Darling and Frhet for tosylation of (2hydroxyethyl) polystyrene [26]. Reaction of tosyloxy derivative 9 with nucleophiles allows the introduction of different functional groups. In this way, reaction with a secondary amine, such as piperazine, in pyridine, or with sodium imidazolide in DMF afforded amines of general structure 11. Additionally, supported alcohol 8 could be directly transformed into esters 10 by treatment with a carboxylic acid in the presence of a strong acid. Thus, reaction of 8 with HBr/ AcOH gave place to acetate 11 (R=CH3) [42] characterized by the presence of a strong C=O band at 1740 cm-1 in the IR spectrum On the other hand, polymer-anchored ester 7 could also be transformed into different functionalities. Saponification of the ester group with KOH in methyglycol was carried out to give polymeric carboxylic acid 12. Reaction is accompanied in the IR spectra by the disappearance of the carbonyl ester band at 1733 cm-1 and the appearance of the novel C=O carboxylic band at 1708 cm-1.

Reaction of carboxylic resin 12 with a secondary amine using tosyl chloride as condensing agent [27] afforded polymeric carboxamide 14. Direct reaction of a secondary amine such as piperazine with ester 7 to obtain amide 14 was also attempted, but the desired transformation was carried out less efficiently. However, direct reaction of 7 with NH20H in basic media, in a mixture of EtOH/ dioxane/Hz0 produced a quantitative transformation into hydroxamic acid 13, characterized by the presence of a carbonyl band at 1704 cm 1. In summary, functionalization of polystyrene resins through long aliphatic spacers can be easily accomplished in a two-step procedure from unfunctionalized polystyrenes and the acid chloride derived from the monoalkyl ester of an alkanedioic acid. Monoalkyl esters of alkanedioic acids are easily obtained [43] and some of them are commercially available. Functionalization degrees can be controlled by an appropriate selection of the amount of reagent, catalyst and reaction times. An important feature of the method is that it can be used for microreticular as well as macroreticular resins. If long reaction times and high temperatures are avoided, no appreciable additional crosslinking of the resins is observed.

Experimental Commercial polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymers were purchased from Fluka and washed and vacuum dried to constant weight before use. IR spectra of KBr pellets of polymers were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 2000 FT-IR spectrophotometer. Gel-phase 13C-NMR spectra of solvent-swollen polymers were obtained in CDC13 on a Varian Gemini 200 instrument at 50.289 MHz equipped with a 5-mm broadband probe. NMR samples were made homogeneous by stirring on an ultrasonic bath. Quantitative elemental analyses were performed in duplicate on a Carlo Erba EA1108 CHNS-O instrument. 3.1.

IR (KBr): 3215, 1733, 1179, 1068 cm-1, peak absent at 1678 cm-1. Elemental analyses always gave inconsistent and non-reproducible results for tosylhydrazones 6. 3.3. Reduction of tosylhydrazones 6 with catecholborane. Preparation of polymeric esters 7 The tosylhydrazone 6 obtained from 1% crosslinked polystyrene (n = 2, R=Et, 1.48 mEq/g, 8.35 g, 12.36 mEq) was suspended in 150 ml of chloroform at 0 under an argon atmosphere. Catecholborane (10 ml, 91.8 mmol) was added and the hydroboration was allowed to continue for 8 h. Sodium acetate trihydrate (8.8 g, 65 mmol) was then added and the reaction mixture was refiuxed for 18 h. After cooling, the resin was filtered and washed with AcOH (3 x ), H20 (3 x ), H20/dioxane (3 x ), MeOH/dioxane (3 x ), MeOH (3 x ), CH2 C12 (3 x) and acetone (3 x) and vacuum dried to constant weight to give polymer 7 (1.94 mEq/ g). IR (KBr): 1733 cm~l, peak absent at 3215, 1678, 1179 and 1068 cm-1. Anal. Calcd. for (C,OHIO)o.ol(C8H8)o.7l(C16H2202)o.28: C, 85.43; H, 8.28. Found: C, 84.93; H, 8.64. 3.4. Reduction of tosylhydrazones 6 with LiAIH4. Preparation of polymeric alcohols 8 A suspension of polymeric tosylhydrazone 6 (1% crosslinked, 1.48 mEq/g, 3.9 g, 5.77 mEq) in 100 ml of dry THF was treated with LiAlH4 powder (1.8 g, 48 mmol) under an argon atmosphere. The mixture was refiuxed for 72 h and, after cooling, the mixture was treated dropwise with 10 ml of H20, 5 ml of 15% NaOH, and 15 ml of water to destroy the excess of reagent. The resin was then filtered and washed with HCl 3 N (3 x), HCl 6 N in H20/MeOH (3x), H20/MeOH (3 x ), MeOH (3 x ), MeOH/dioxane (3 x ), dioxane (3 x ), CH202 (3 x) and acetone (3 x) and vacuum dried to give polymer 8 (2.12 mEq/g). IR (KBr): 3400 (broad), 1067 and 1046 cm-1, peak absents at 3215, 1733, 1678 and 1179 cm-1. Anal. Calcd. for (C1oHlo)o.ol(C8H8)o.7l(C14H200)o.28: C, 87.96; H, 8.60. Found: C, 87.61; H, 8.85.

The preparation of functionalized polystyrene-divinylbenzene resins containing functional groups bonded to the polymeric matrix by a long alkyl chain has been accomplished in a two-step procedure from unfunctionalized resins and the acid chloride of a monoalkyl ester of an alkanedioic acid. The procedure is useful for the preparation of spacer-modified polymers of variable crosslinking degrees, including highly crosslinked macroreticular resins such as XAD-4. The high mobility of the chains is revealed by the easy analysis of the polymers by gel-phase 13C-NMR spectroscopy.
