The hydrogenation selectivity of these catalysts for polyunsaturated cycloolefines (1,5,9-cyclododecatriene, cyclopentadiene) and unsaturated carbonyl compounds (mesityl oxide, crotonaldehyde acrylic aldehyde) was investigated. Some important factors (pore size, crosslinkage of polymer supports, donor atoms and substituents thereon) for the tailoring of supports and ligands which have great influence over the hydrogenation selectivity of the supported metal catalysts are discussed.

Introduction Selective hydrogenation of polyunsaturated organic compounds and unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a subject drawing great interest and attention of synthetic chemists in recent years [1-7]. This is due to the fact that in a lot of cases this reaction is the key step in the synthesis and manufacture of many useful fine chemicals such as drugs, perfumes, pesticides, food additives, petrochemicals and so on. Traditional heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts usually use inorganic supports such as active carbon, silica, silica gel, alumina, etc. The main shortcoming of the inorganic supports is that the tailoring of these materials is difficult, as a result in a lot of cases the catalysts prepared do not have * Corresponding author.

In contrast, organic polymer supports have the advantage of being easily tailored. During the past two decades, numbers of papers dealing with the synthesis and properties of organic polymer-supported metal catalysts for selective hydrogenation were published [8-11], and it is worth noting that a few excellent reviews have discussed the shape selectivity and other macromolecular effects of polymersupported metal catalysts [12,13]. This paper reports our recent work on the tailoring of functional polystyrene-supported metal (Ru, Rh, Pd) catalysts for selective hydrogenation of polyunsaturated cycloolefines and unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The main aim of this paper is to indicate and emphasize the importance of tailoring of supports and ligands for obtaining polymer-supported metal catalysts with higher selectivity. 62 2. Experimental 2.1. Reagents H. Li, B. He/ Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 61-66 1,5,9-Cyclododecatriene (CDT, b.p. 96-100/ 10 mm Hg, contains Z,E,E-CDT 94.5% and E,E,E-CDT 5.5%) was distilled under reduced pressure before use. Benzene and THF were purified according to Ref. [14]. Other reagents were either analytically or chemically pure. 2.2. Synthesis of polymer supports Copolymer beads of styrene-divinylbenzene with different crosslinkages and different pore diameters were synthesized by suspension copolymerization [15]. 2.3. Synthesis of polymeric ligands Polymeric phosphine ligands (I-Ph-CHZ PPh2) and various polymeric amine ligands (I-Ph-CHZNRjRz) were synthesized according to Ref. [14]. 2.4. Synthesis of polymer-supported metal catalysts The homogeneous ruthenium complex RuC12 (PPh3)3 was prepared according to Ref. [16]. The supported ruthenium catalysts were prepared as follows: beads of polymeric phosphine ligands were preswollen in benzene for 4 h at room temperature under nitrogen. The benzene solution of RuC12(PPh3)3 was added dropwise to the suspension solution mentioned above under continual stirring. Stirring was kept for 12 h at refluxing temperature under nitrogen. After cooling to room temperature, the beads were filtered out from the suspension, extracted (Soxhlet) for 2 h with benzene under nitrogen and then vacuum-dried at 60. The supported rhodium catalysts were synthesized according to Ref. [14]. The supported palladium catalysts were prepared as follows [17]: To the suspension of preswollen polymeric amine beads in acetone a certain amount of acetone solution of palla- dium acetate was added dropwise under stirring. The suspension was stirred for 72 h at refluxing temperature. After cooling to room temperature, the beads were filtered off, and washed with methanol. Then the beads were suspended in methanol and this suspension was stirred for 6 h at refluxing temperature. A certain amount of methanol solution of sodium hydroxide was added dropwise to the suspension mentioned above. The reaction was kept for 0.5 h under refluxing. After cooling to room temperature the beads were filtered off, washed with methanol several times, then vacuum-dried at 50. 2.5. Characterization of polymer supports and catalysts The pore diameters of polymer supports were determined according to Ref. [18]. The metal content of the polymer-supported catalysts was determined after the catalysts had been decomposed by HC104-HN03. The rhodium and palladium content of the catalysts and hydrogenated reaction solutions were determined according to the methods described earlier [15,19]. The determination of ruthenium was carried out according to the method described in Ref. [20]. XRD analysis indicates that the average diameter of palladium particles of supported palladium catalysts is 33 A. XPS analysis of the supported palladium catalysts indicates that a coordinate interaction exists between the polymeric ligands and the metal atoms. (For example, the binding energy of Nls in I-Ph-CHZNMez is 398.7 eV, while in the corresponding polymer-supported palladium catalysts it is 399.6 eV Similar results were observed for the other supported metal catalysts.) 2.6. Hydrogenation reactions Hydrogenation reactions of unsaturated substrates were carried out in a 100-ml autoclave. The hydrogenated products were analyzed with GC using Chromosorb 6201 as the carrier and 1,2,3,4-tetracyanoethoxybutane as the fixed liquid. H. Li, B.

Tailoring of polymer supports: influence of pore size and crosslinkage of supports over the selectivity Cyclododecene (CDE) is a very useful intermediate for the synthesis of some fine chemicals. For example, it can be used to synthesize a perfume with musk odor. In order to obtain CDE, the following route, that is, the unselective hydrogenation method, is used (Scheme 1). A more simple and convenient method to prepare CDE is the catalytic selective hydrogenation of CDT However, if the catalyst used for this purpose does not possess high hydrogenation selectivity, the formation of cyclododecadiene (CDD) and cyclododecane (CDA) is unavoidable and undesirable (Scheme 2).

' Concentration of catalytic active metal (ruthenium) in the hydrogenated reaction solution, is the same for all tables. In the course of investigating the selectivity of polymer-supported ruthenium catalysts (Cat. 1-4) for the hydrogenation of CDT we found that the tailoring of supports is very important for obtaining highly selective catalysts. -Ph-CHZ-PPh2)xRUClz(PPh3)3_x (Cat. 1-5) The catalysts listed in Table 1 are prepared from the same crosslinked polystyrene, they have exactly the same support crosslinkage, bead size and ruthenium content, but different pore size. It is very clear, from Table 1, that the pore size of the catalysts has an obvious influence over the CDE formation selectivity. Only the catalyst possessing an appropriate pore size (Cat. 2 in Table 1) showed the highest selectivity. If the pores of supports are too large or too small, the catalyst's selectivity will decrease. Here the restriction effect of pores channels on the substrate and product molecules can be seen very clearly. As CDE and CDA have different molecular structures, the molecules of the former are bulkier than those of the latter. If the pore channels can restrict the access of CDE molecules to the catalytic active center, i.e. metal active species, to avoid the further hydrogenation of CDE, the CDE formation selectivity of the catalyst could thus be increased. 64 H. Li, B. He /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 61-66 Table 2 Influence of crosslinkage of supports upon the hydrogenation selectivity of polymer-supported ruthenium catalysts a Cat. b Crosslinkage Conversion Selectivity Ruthenium of supports of CDT for CDE leaching (%) * (%) formation (ppm) (%) 2 10 93 5 14 89 84 0.8 79 0.6 a Reaction conditions of hydrogenation are the same as shown in Table 1. h Average pore diameters of the two catalysts are the same, i.e. 2.0 x 102 A. The crosslinkage of supports may also have a certain influence upon the selectivity of polymersupported catalysts. The catalysts listed in Table 2 (Cat. 2 and 5) possess the same pore size, but different support crosslinkages, they showed slightly different CDE formation selectivity when they were used to catalyze the hydrogenation of CDT under the same reaction conditions. This is probably due to the fact that the catalyst with higher support crosslinkage cannot swell well in the reaction mixture, so the diffusion of CDT molecules towards the inside of pore channels, where the catalytic active sites are situated, and the diffusion of CDE molecules towards the outside of pore channels is restricted. 3.2. Tailoring of polymeric ligands: influence of donor atoms and substituents thereon over the selectivity Not only the structures of supports have influence over the selectivity of polymer-supported hydrogenation catalysts, the structures of polymeric ligands, i.e. donor atoms and substituents thereon, also have obvious influence over the catalysts' hydrogenation selectivity. The polymeric phosphine-supported rhodium catalysts (Cat. 6 and 7) I-Ph-CHZ-PPhz-Rh(CO)ZCl (Cat. 6) I-Ph-CHZ-NPh2-Rh(CO)zCl (Cat. 7) are synthesized from the same crosslinked polystyrene. That is to say, the crosslinkage, pore di- Table 3 Influence of donor atoms on the hydrogenation selectivity of polymer-supported rhodium catalysts a Cat. b Conversion Selectivity for of CDT CDE formation (%) (%) 6 92 80 7 97 67 Rhodium leaching (PPm) 0.8 2.8 a Reaction conditions of hydrogenation are the same as shown in Table 1. b Rh%, 0.5%; average pore diameter, 2.0 x lOZA; bead size, 0.2-0.4 mm, crosslinkage of supports, 10%. ameter and bead size of the supports are exactly the same. Not only that, the substituents linked to the donor atoms are also the same. The only difference between the two catalysts is that the donor atoms of the polymeric ligands are different, one P and the other N. When these two catalysts were used to catalyze the hydrogenation of CDT, the CDE formation selectivity of the two catalysts showed an obvious difference. The selectivity of polymeric phosphine-supported rhodium catalyst higher than that of the polymeric amine-supported catalyst (Table 3). This may possibly be due to the fact that the phosphine ligand has higher electron-donating ability than the amine ligand, with the result that the density of electron cloud on rhodium atom of Cat. 6 is higher than that of Cat. 7. The moderate increase of electron density of catalytic active center restrained the coordination of CDE molecules with the active center, and thus increased the catalyst's selectivity. The substituents on donor atoms may also exert obvious influence upon the hydrogenation selectivity of polymer-supported metal catalysts. For example, the only difference between the following polymeric amine-supported rhodium catalysts (Cat. 8-13) is that the substituents linked to the donor atoms (N) are different (Table 4). I-Ph-CHZ-NRIR2-Rh(CO)ZCl (Cat. 8-13) When these catalysts were used to catalyze the hydrogenation of CDT, the diversity of se- H. Li, B.

Among them the polymeric primary amine-supported rhodium catalyst (Cat. 8) showed the highest selectivity. The increase of amount and size of substituents on the donor atom increased the steric hindrance of coordination of the substrate molecules with the catalytic active center, with the result that the catalytic activity and selectivity of catalysts decreased. If we tailor the supports and ligands of the polymer-supported metal catalysts carefully, it is possible to obtain a catalyst with higher selectivity. Recently, we synthesized a polymeric aminesupported palladium catalyst (Cat. 14) and used it to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of cyclopentadiene and some unsaturated carbonyl compounds. I-Ph-CH2-N(CH3)Z/Pd (Cat. 14) Experimental results showed that this catalyst can selectively reduce the carbon-carbon double bonds and does not reduce the carbonyl groups in the unsaturated carbonyl compounds (Table 5) The lifetime of Cat. 14 is also very good. For example, in order to prepare methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) we used it to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of mesityl oxide (MO): (CH3)ZC=CH-CO-CH3 Cat. 14 MO (CH3)ZCH-CHZ-CO-CH3 MIBK Under batch operation conditions after being reused for 10 times the catalyst's activity and selectivity did not show any substantial changes, and no palladium could be detected in the hydrogenated reaction solution (Table 6) 4. Conclusions The tailoring of supports and ligands of polymer-supported metal catalysts is a piece of extremely fine and complicated work. Many 66 H. Li, B.

According to the our experience, however, the catalysts prepared in this way hardly possess satisfactory selectivity, especially in the case of selective hydrogenation of polyunsaturated cycloolefines and unsaturated carbonyl compounds. We have discussed some important factors in the tailoring of polymer supports and ligands which have great influence on the selectivity of polymer-supported metal catalysts for the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated cycloolefines and unsaturated carbonyl compounds. If we tailor the supports and ligands carefully, highly selective polymer-supported metal catalysts can be obtained.

Some important factors (pore size, crosslinkage of polymer supports, donor atoms and substituents thereon) for the tailoring of supports and ligands which have great influence over the hydrogenation selectivity of the supported metal catalysts are discussed.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "1995-09-30", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/1381514895000114", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Li, Hong"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "He, Binglin"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/1381514895000114"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1381514895000114"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "1381-5148(95)00011-4", "prism:volume": "26", "prism:publisher": "Published by Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "Tailoring of polymer-supported metal catalysts for selective hydrogenation", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 1995 Published by Elsevier B.V.", "prism:issueName": "Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Polymer Supported Reactions in Organic Chemistry", "openaccess": "0", "prism:issn": "13815148", "prism:issueIdentifier": "1-3", "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Polymeric catalysts"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Selective hydrogenation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ruthenium"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rhodium"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Palladium"}], "openaccessArticle": "false", "prism:publicationName": "Reactive and Functional Polymers", "prism:number": "1-3", "openaccessSponsorType": null, "prism:pageRange": "61-66", "prism:endingPage": "66", "pubType": "fla", "prism:coverDisplayDate": "September 1995", "prism:doi": "10.1016/1381-5148(95)00011-4", "prism:startingPage": "61", "dc:identifier": "doi:10.1016/1381-5148(95)00011-4", "openaccessSponsorName": null}, "link": {"@rel": "abstract", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029368096"}}
