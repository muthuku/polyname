Ebdon, Melanie J. Shepherd The Polymer Centre, School of Physics and Chemistry Lancaster University, Lancaster, LAI 4YA, UK Accepted 13 January 1995 Abstract The work-up of ozonides derived from the ozonolysis of methacrylate copolymers containing main chain unsaturation has been studied. We have used: periodate supported on Amberlyst A26 (SPIR) (a supported oxidizing agent); polystyrene-supported diphenyl phosphine (SPR) (a mild supported reducing agent) and borohydride supported on Amberlyst A26 (BER) (a more powerful supported reducing agent). Poly(butyl methacrylate-cobutadiene)s were synthesized by starve fed emulsion polymerization. These materials, and the homopolymer, poly(butyl methacrylate), were then ozonized at different temperatures and worked up with each of the reagents listed above. The differing work-ups generated telechelic oligomers in good yield (99%+). Changes in molecular weight with ozonization temperature were observed. Aldehyde end-groups were detected by tH- and '3C-NMR. Hydroxyl end-groups were observed by FTIR and \"C-NMR spectroscopy. The presence of hydroxyl groups was also further confirmed by forming the tosylate. Carboxyl groups were observed by FTIR and 13C-NMR and quantified by titration. SPR-generated oligomers had approximately 80% of the chain-ends aldehyde functional, BER and SPIR gave oligomers with 99+% hydroxyl and carboxyl functionality, respectively.

Introduction Telechelic oligomers are of use in several technological spheres (e.g. reactive injection moulding, surface coatings, adhesives, etc.). They also find use as precursors in the synthesis of block and graft copolymers. Recently, workers at Lancaster have reported the synthesis of acrylic oligomers by controlled ozonolysis of polymers containing unsaturation in the main * Corresponding author. 1381-5148/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved. SSDI1381-5148(95)00014-3 chain [1-4]. Unsaturation may be introduced by radical copolymerization of vinyl monomers with a diene or an aryl acetylene. Ozonolysis of these copolymers leads to chain scission at the site of the double bond. It is possible to predetermine the nature of the end-group functionality by careful choice of work-up conditions (see Scheme 1). The nature of the functionality is dependent on the chemistry used in work-up and on the substituents adjacent to the ozonide. Reductive work-up (e.g. Zn/acetic acid, PPh3 or NaBH4) leads to hydroxyl or aldehyde/ketone 146 R end-groups while oxidative (e.g. Na104) work-up leads to carboxyl or ketone end-groups. Dihydroxy telechelic polybutadiene has been synthesized in this way [5]. Several authors have also previously studied the ozonolysis of poly(isobutylene-co-diene)s with a view to the preparation of diacid and glycol functional oligomers [6-8] All work on preparing telechelic oligomers suffers from difficulties in purifying the products. Precipitation usually leads to loss of the lower molecular weight fractions, this problem being more acute as the average molecular weight of the product decreases. Similarly, purification techniques involving dialysis or ultrafiltration can lead to loss of low molecular weight material. The amphiphilic nature of many of the products also presents problems in liquid/liquid extraction. Almost invariably, the oligomers act as surfactants so that in aqueous washing procedures stable oil/water emulsions are formed. With these problems in mind, we have recently explored the use of polymer-supported S. Rimmer et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 145-155 R O. O o- .

In this paper, we present the results of our use of polymer-supported periodate, borohydride and diphenylphosphine in the synthesis of carboxylic acid, hydroxyl and aldehyde functional telechelic oligomers by the ozonolysis technique. To our knowledge only one piece of work on the use of supported reagents for the work-up of ozonides has been reported. Ferraboschi et al. [9], used polystyrene-supported diphenylphosphine to convert ozonides produced from steroids to aldehydes. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Butyl methacrylate (Aldrich). The MEHQ inhibitor was removed by washing with 2% sodium hydroxide solution and dionized water. The deinhibited monomer was dried over anhydrous calcium chloride and then fractionally distilled under reduced pressure, prior to use. S. Rimmer et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 145-155 Potassium persulphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and sodium dodecylsulphate (Aldrich) were used as supplied. Butadiene (Aldrich) was purified by distillation on a vacuum line. Deionized water was used for the emulsion polymerizations. Supported borohydride and supported phosphine resins (Aldrich) were washed, in a column, with methanol prior to use. One litre of methanol was slowly eluted through the column per 10 g of resin. The resins were then dried at room temperature under vacuum. Supported periodate resin was prepared from Amberlyst A26, by ion exchange with sodium periodate. One hundred grams of supported periodate resin was prepared by slow elution of an aqueous solution of sodium periodate through a column of Amberlyst A26, in the chloride form. The periodate content of this material was 2.4 mmol/g (measured by thiosulphate titration) Triethylamine (TEA) (Aldrich) was purified by distillation from calcium hydride. The middle fraction was collected and stored under argon and over A3 molecular sieves. Toluene (Aldrich) was dried over phosphorus pentoxide and then distilled onto A3 molecular sieves. Tosyl chloride (Aldrich) was stored under argon and used as supplied. 2.2. Preparation of copolymers Monomer starved emulsion copolymerization was used so that large quantities of copolymers could be prepared (typically 200 g per polymerization) with uniform repeat unit compositions. Both poly(butyl methacrylate-co-butadiene) (PBM/BD) and poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) lattices were synthesized. The recipe used was as follows: Monomer mixture Water Sodium dodecylsulphate Potassium persulphate Potassium dihydrogen phosphate 200 g 400 ml 7.5 g 1.0 g 0.2 g 147 The solids contents of the latices were 33% by weight. The polymerizations were run at 60. The monomers were fed into the reaction vessel at a rate of 0.8 ml/min. Typically, around 50% of the butadiene co-monomer was incorporated in this manner. The solid polymer was isolated by coagulation of the latices into methanol. The products were then dried and reprecipitated from THF solutions into methanol. 2.3. Ozonolysis Ozonolyses were carried out by bubbling an ozone/oxygen mixture through copolymer solutions, at a rate of 1.74 g of ozone h-1. One gram of polymer was ozonized in each sample. Ozone was produced by an electrical discharge type ozone generator. The ozonolyses were performed at various temperatures, in chloroform. All ozonolyses were carried until ozone could be detected in the solvent. 2.4. Work-up The ozonides were worked up by adding either polystyrene-supported diphenyl phosphine, borohydride supported on Amberlyst A26 or periodate supported on Amberlyst A26. These mixtures were then agitated vigorously. Finally, the reagent was filtered off and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation. The masses of the products were recorded. Typically, the borohydride and periodate preparations were worked-up for 48 h while the supported phosphine required 7 days. All reductions and oxidations were performed at room temperature. 2.5. Analysis All the samples were analyzed by FTIR (Perkin-Elmer 1720X) and by 1H- and 13CNMR (JEOL GSX 400). Theoretical chemical shifts values were calculated using wellestablished additivity rules [10]. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were determined by GPC using Polymer Laboratories 148 S. Rimmer et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 145-155 Styragel\" columns with THF as solvent. The Table 2 acid contents of the samples were determined by Molecular weights of oligomers derived from borohydride acid/base titration. reduced ozonides 2.6. Tosylation of oligomers The hydroxyl functionality of the borohydride reduced samples was confirmed by formation of the tosylate derivative. Tosylation was carried out as follows: Triethylamine (5 ml) and tosyl chloride (2.5 g) were mixed together at 0, under dry nitrogen for 30 min. A dry solution of the oligomer (5 g) in toluene (50 ml) was then added dropwise. After complete addition of the oligomer solution, the reaction vessel was allowed to reach room temperature and stirred, under nitrogen, for 4 days. The precipitated solid was then filtered off and the solvent removed from the product, by rotary evaporation. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Copolymer synthesis The molecular weights of the polymers are given in Table 1. 3.2. Supported borohydride resin (BER) Sodium borohydride has been used extensively in the synthesis of alcohols from ozonides. The excess borohydride is usually removed by acidification, followed by aqueous extraction of the borate. In earlier work on the synthesis of dihydroxy functional telechelic oligomers from ozonides, sodium borohydride was used as the Table 1 Molecular weights of polymers Polymer MMW (kg/mol) (kg/mol) 3030.7 309.9 550.6 PBMA 876.4 PBM/BD1 a 98.7 PBM/BD2b 126.1 a BD content = 1.0 mol%. b BD content = 7.5 mol%.

It was found that the final yields of oligomer were low and the liquid/liquid extraction of the borate was plagued with the formation of emulsions. BER has been successfully used to eliminate both of the above problems. Table 2 shows the molecular weights of the PBMA oligomers synthesized. Ozonolysis has been carried out at various temperatures. In all samples, the polymer ozonide solution was agitated with the BER beads for 48 h. For comparison purposes, the results on PBMA are included. In all cases, 100% of the material ozonized has been recovered. The removal of excess reagent/borate simply involves filtration of the reaction mixture. An important observation concerns the changes in molecular weight of the oligomer with ozonolysis temperature. That is, as the temperature is decreased the molecular weight of the oligomer increases. This effect is also observed in ozonization of the homopolymer. In all cases, the reaction is carried out until excess ozone can be detected in the reaction solvent. NMR of the oligomers has shown that at this point all the olefin units have reacted with ozone. It can, therefore, be concluded that the degree of conversion of olefin groups is the same in all oligomer preparations (i.e. 100%).

Fig. la shows a FTIR spectrum of a PBMA oligomer worked-up with BER (M= 2500 g/ mol); the hydroxyl group can be clearly seen as a broad peak around 3400 cm-t. The presence of hydroxyl end-groups has unequivocally been proved by formation of the tosylate ester. Fig. 2 shows SEC chromatograms of the PBMA tosylate; dual UV/RI detectors were used.

In type I end-groups, the methyleneoxy carbon, C*, is 4 carbons removed from the penultimate stereocentre and is thus influenced by the microstructure of the end dyads. Therefore, two type I resonances are observed, the down field of which, I(r), arises from racemic dyads while the other, I(m), is due to meso dyads. Type II end- groups are the result of addition of a butadienyl end macroradical to a butyl methacrylate monomer. The methyleneoxy carbon, C* in these structures is too far removed from the penultimate stereocentre to be influenced by dyad microstructure so that the spectrum is simplified to a single peak. The ratio of integrations confirms this hypothesis; thus typically the ratio of II: [I(r) + I(m)] is 1:1. Resonances which could be assigned to aldehyde or carboxyl end-groups were not observed by either 1H- or t3C-NMR spectroscopy in oligomers prepared via BER reduction. 3.3. Supported phosphine resin (SPR) Triphenyl phosphine has been used to synthesize aldehydes from ozonides. The by-product of this reaction, triphenylphosineoxide, is well known as a difficult substance to remove from organic reaction mixtures.

Table 4 shows the molecular weights obtained from copolymers with different ozonolysis temperatures. The ozonide solutions were agitated with the SPR beads for 7 days at room temperature. All the material which was ozonized was recovered after work-up. Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectrum of a dialdehyde functional PBMA (M= 2000 g/mol) oligomer. The small peak in the -OH stretch region (3000+ cm-1) indicates that either hydroxyl or carboxyl end-groups may be present, but in very low concentration. This fact is further substantiated by the inability to tosylate these materials. The percentage of chain ends which are aldehydic, in oligomers derived from PBM/BD2, have been calculated and are shown in Table 5. These values were found by determining the acid content, by titration, and the aldehyde content, by integration of the 1H-NMR signals. However, the acid contents of the products from ozonization of PBMA and the PBM/BDl were too vanishingly small to be necessary in these calculations. The hydroxyl content was assumed to be negligible. As can be seen from these results, the majority of the chain ends are aldehyde functional. S.

Thus, it should be possible to differentiate between the two species by NMR. The resonances of the aldehydic protons can clearly be observed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. An example spectrum is shown in Fig. 5. Three peaks can be observed in the spectrum in the aldehyde region. The aldehyde content calculated from integration of the total area of these peaks is consistent with the measured trend in molecular weights, obtained from GPC. However, the integration ratios of these 3 resonances do not mirror the 13C-methyleneoxy peaks discussed in the previous section. The calculated and observed I3C shifts for the aldehydic carbon end-group are given in Table 6. Fig. 6 shows an example of a 13C spectrum in this region. 152 S.

Supported periodate resin (SPIR) The removal of inorganic oxidizing agents and reduced by-products from oligomer solutions usually involves aqueous liquid/liquid extraction. The hydrophilic nature of the acid end-group means that the telechelic oligomer has surfactant properties, so that stable emulsions are often formed. We have therefore investigated the use of a supported oxidizing agent to overcome this problem. The molecular weights of the synthesized materials are shown in Table 7. The SPIR beads were agitated with the ozonide solutions for 48 h at room temperature. Similar trends in these as in the previous sets of data are observed. That is, increasing temperature gives a decrease in molecular weight owing to ozonization of the PBMA chain. The acid contents of the low molecular weight series (i.e. oligomers derived from PBM/BD2) have been determined by acid/ base titration. These data also show increasing molecular weight with decreasing temperature of ozonolysis (i.e. decreasing acid content with decreasing temperature). As can also be seen in Table 8, the oligomers are almost totally acid end-functional. Yields of product approached 100% in all cases. S.

The broad OH stretch characteristic of carboxyl groups can clearly be observed. Further evidence of the presence of carboxyl end-groups is provided by t3C spectroscopy. Fig. 8 shows the resonances arising from methylene carbons a to the carboxyl end-groups. Table 9 gives the calculated and observed shifts of these carbons. By examination of the base-line noise in 13C spectra of low molecular weight SPR-reduced oligomers, it was possible to locate the same two sets of resonances. They were of weak intensity, but had the same shift values and the same relative areas as the peaks listed in Table 9 and shown in Fig. 8. The BER-reduced samples did not produce these peaks. From the previous discussion it should be recalled that SPRreduced oligomers contained some acid functionality, whereas BER-reduced samples do not contain any detectable acid. So it seems reasonable to conclude that the resonances of Fig. 8 and Table 9 are due to methylene carbons a to the carboxyl end-groups. Methylenes from both type I and II end-groups are within 4 bonds of the penultimate stereocentre, so that both may show tacticity effects due to dyad microstructure.

Conclusion Polymer-supported reagents have been used successfully as aids in the preparation of telechelic oligomers. The use of these materials has resulted in increased yields (99+%) compared with procedures employing conventional reagents. A major problem with oligomer synthesis is loss of low molecular weight product during work-up procedures, such as liquid/ liquid extraction. Since the isolation of product from polymer-supported reactions involves only filtration and removal of solvent, any loss of product, arising from fractionation between product solution and extractant, has been eliminated. Oligomers with very high end-group functionality can be prepared. The use of a polymersupported phosphine yields oligomers with aldehyde groups at approximately 80% of all chain ends. Polymer-supported borohydride and periodate give oligomers with 99%+ hydroxyl and carboxyl functionality, respectively. References [1] J.R. Ebdon, NJ. Flint and P Hodge, Eur. Polym.

The work-up of ozonides derived from the ozonolysis of methacrylate copolymers containing main chain unsaturation has been studied. We have used: periodate supported on Amberlyst A26 (SPIR) (a supported oxidizing agent); polystyrene-supported diphenyl phosphine (SPR) (a mild supported reducing agent) and borohydride supported on Amberlyst A26 (BER) (a more powerful supported reducing agent). Poly(butyl methacrylate-cobutadiene)s were synthesized by starve fed emulsion polymerization. These materials, and the homopolymer, poly(butyl methacrylate), were then ozonized at different temperatures and worked up with each of the reagents listed above. The differing work-ups generated telechelic oligomers in good yield (99%+). Changes in molecular weight with ozonization temperature were observed. Aldehyde end-groups were detected by 1H- and 13C-NMR. Hydroxyl end-groups were observed by FTIR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. The presence of hydroxyl groups was also further confirmed by forming the tosylate. Carboxyl groups were observed by FTIR and 13C-NMR and quantified by titration. SPR-generated oligomers had approximately 80% of the chain-ends Adehyde functional, BER and SPIR gave oligomers with 99+% hydroxyl and carboxyl functionality, respectively.
