Keywords: Heterogeneous molybdenum catalyst; Polymeric molybdenum complex; Epoxidation reaction 1. Introduction Molybdenum-containing catalysts are used in many industrial processes. For example, Mo(VI) naphthenates are active homogeneous catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins (HALCON process) with organic hydroperoxides [1]. In order to successfully heterogenize [2] conventional Mo(VI) catalysts, we have studied the preparation and catalytic activity of a Mo(VI)-grafted copolymeric resin (R1) whose active portion had the following structure [3,4]: 0 0 II f--r II ~CH2CH_C-N N-CCH_CH_ -N-CH=CH= N- CH, CHI I I COON COOH x * Corresponding author. 1381-5148/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved. SSDI 1381-5148(95)00012-7 It may be observed that the above structure contains two carboxylic groups and two tertiary amino groups; therefore, it bears a strong resemblance with several soluble organic precursors (e.g. 2,6-pyridine dicarboxylic acid) reported in the literature [5]. In order to ascertain if the observed catalytic activity was strictly related to the precursor of the particular structure of resin Rl, several carboxylic stepwise polyaddition resins were preliminarily investigated (unpublished results from our laboratory). Accordingly, a series of resins carrying only one carboxylic group and one tertiary amino group in their repeating unit (n = 1, 2, 3, 6) II /-\\ II -CH,CH,C-N N-CCH~CH=-N- (CH, )nCOOH 68 E. Tempesti et a1 /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 67-74 was studied. We found that the Mo(VI) complexes of these resins had, on the whole, a vastly inferior catalytic activity if compared with Rl. The activity apparently decreased on increasing the distance between the tertiary amino group and the carboxy group. On the other hand, a new series of polymeric carboxylic acids obtained by stepwise polyaddition of bis-thiols to 2,2-bis(acrylamido)acetic acid has recently been prepared [6] and studied [7] for their physicochemical properties and heavy metal ion complexing ability. These polymers have the following structure: 0 0 II II H,CH=C-NHCHNH-CCH_CH=-S-R- i COON R = (CH.,),,, (CH.,yj, (CH.,),y, CH(OH)-CH(OH) and can be easily obtained in the form of crosslinked resins. In the above structure, the carboxy group is accompanied by two neighboring amido groups. We thought it possible that these groups could play an adjuvating role in Mo(VI) grafting, e.g., anchimeric assistance by N and/or electron backdonation. The aim of this paper is to report on the preparation of these resins (specifically with R=CHZCHZ) (R2) and their evaluation as catalysts liquid-phase oxidation reactions. 2. Experimental 2.1. Instruments Infrared spectra were run on a Perkin-Elmer 782 spectrophotometer. SEM micrographs were obtained with a Cambridge Stereoscan Analyzer 760. Atomic absorption measurements were performed with a Varian AA-475 apparatus. 2.2. Materials The poly(thioether-amido-acid) crosslinked resin R2 was synthesized by first reacting 2,2'ethanedithiol to 2,2'-bis(acrylamido)acetic acid, and secondly treating the macromonomer obtained, without isolation, with an equal weight of N-vinylpirrolidinone, as described elsewhere The Mo(VI) grafting was performed under acidic conditions (1.0<pH<3) by water elimination between molybdic acid and the surface of the carboxylic acids groups, as previously described [2]. The grafting procedure is conveniently carried out in dioxane/water (40:30, v/v), while the removal of water is performed by azeotropic distillation under mild experimental conditions. The catalytic activity of resin R2 was evaluated according to a procedure described elsewhere [9]. No attempt was made to recover and re-use the polymer catalyst; accordingly, the extent of Mo leach from the polymers, if any, has not been evaluated. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Preparation of the resin The preparation of the resin was performed by a standard procedure, whose experimental details have been reported elsewhere, involving two reaction steps. First, a vinyl-terminated poly(thioether-amido-acid) (PTAC) macromonomer was prepared by stepwise polyaddition reaction of 2,2'-ethanedithiol to 2,2'-bis(acrylamido)acetic acid. Secondly, the above macromonomer, without isolation, was treated with an equal weight of N-vinylpirrolidinone and a radical initiator to give the final product. During polymerization the PTAC macromonomer itself, being terminated at both ends with vinyl groups, acts as crosslinking agent. It must be emphasized that the polymerization has been carried out in aqueous solution. The obtained final hydrogel has been subsequently ground down to 50-100 gm size. The microparticles are irregular in shape and apparently not porous (5 mz/g surface BET area). The whole procedure is reported in Scheme 1. E.

Mo(VI) grafting The samples were prepared using molybdic acid obtained either from Na2Mo04-HCl or by ionic-exchange on resins. It has been found indeed that by using the second technique the possibility that hydrochloric acid induces the formation of molybdenyl chloroanions MoOChis avoided. These ions (see EPR results) [10] are known to stabilize their compounds coordinatively and to inhibit the transfer of their 4dt electron to oxygen. Furthermore, they do not give OZ derivatives by the action of the OZ. 3.3. Morphological analyses The results of SEM are reported in Figs. 13. Of course, the morphology displayed is only superficial and the observed changes may be of limited value. However, the following considerations can be tentatively made. In particular, Fig. 1 shows the pictures of R2, as such, at two different magnifications. At both lower and higher magnification the resin micro- 69 i COON AIBN, fi0. N-vinylpyrroliJinonc CROSSLINKED RESIN R? Scheme 1 granules have a very irregular scale-shaped morphology. On grafting Mo(VI) (see Fig. 2), the structure is sensibly modified, since it becomes finely porous. At higher magnifications, creakes and holes become apparent, probably due to strains induced by the drying procedure. Finally, Fig. 3 shows the micrograph relative to the catalyst recovered after epoxidation reaction. It may be seen that the grain-size has been drastically reduced, and at higher magnifications the surface appears smooth and fractureless. 3.4. IR analyses 3.4.1. Coordination site The IR spectra of grafted and ungrafted resins are reported in Fig. 4. The major differences refer to the disappearance of the shoulder at 1755 cm-t and the shift of the whole band relative to C=O frequency from 1655 to 1620 cm-t. Minor modifications seem to be apparent with regard to the OH (3400-3450 cm-t ) and C-N (1230-1030 cm-1) vibrations. Accordingly, it may 70 E.

Moreover, we think it probable that not only the C=O groups, but also the amidic groups participate to Mo(VI) complexation, inasmuch as we found that also a resin with the same overall structure, but in which the CONH-CH(COOH)-NHCO moiety was replaced by CONH-CHZ-NHCO, and in which, therefore, no carboxylic groups were present, is able to bind discrete quantities of Mo(VI) [11].

Dioxo- and peroxo-Mo(VI) complexes Tables 1 and 2 report the typical absorption bands observed for dioxo- and peroxo-Mo(VI) complexes. These complexes have been synthesized exactly in the same experimental conditions, except for the use of H202 in the grafting procedure, specifically present for the peroxocomplexes and absent in the case of dioxocomplexes. To further emphasize the structural differences between the cited complexes, two known homogeneous catalysts Mo(O)(02) [(CSH3N(COZ)z] (Scheme 2, I) and [Mo(O)(OZ)Z ((CSH3N(COZ)] (Scheme 2, II) [12] have been used.

Referring to Tables 1 and 2 it may be seen that the fundamental difference between dioxoand peroxo-Mo(VI) complexes is due to some presence of the peroxo bridges, which may then be related to the catalytic activity. 3.5. Catalytic activity and kinetic data A good agreement between calculated and experimental data has been obtained by using the following model equation (1), in which the strong time dependence of the reaction rate is justified by assuming that the amount of active catalyst decrease due to complex interaction with the active products until an equilibrium concentration is obtained. r = k ~ KS ~ [ROZH][ol][MeL] where [MeL] _ [MeL]o - KS ~ [MeL] ~ [ROZH] - C1 - k,'al ~ ~t ki[MeL] ~ [ROH]' Z dt ,alKi al 0 - ~i 'ep~ J t k;,eP[MeL] ~ [epox]1/2 dt Ki,e 0 In this equation [9], KS is the equilibrium constant of the catalyst-hydroperoxide complex, while k;,,,;, k;,eP and K;,a;, K;,eP are the direct rate constants and equilibrium constants of formation of the inhibited complexes between the catalyst and the alcohol and epoxide, respectively.

Referring to the scheme reported below: ROH,epoz MROH,>a> McL MeL ROH epox MeL RO.,H of MeL RO.,H oi where MeL = metal complex; MeL R02H metal hydroperoxide adduct; MeL R02H of = metal-hydroperoxide-olefine adduct; MeL(ROH, epoxy = metal-alcohol or metalepoxide adduct. It may be seen that, prior to olefin insertion, the mode of formation of dmetal allylperoxidic intermediate MeL ~ R02H may be adversely affected by a deactivation mechanism, which implies a rapidly increasing anion exchange by more basic species (ROH, epoxy which can hardly be displaced further by the hydroperoxide. Table 4 reports the kinetic data obtained with both polymeric heterogeneous catalysts Rl and R2, together with the data obtained with the already cited homogeneous catalysts (I) and (II). In terms of prevention of catalyst degradation, it may be observed that no substantial differences occur for Rl and R2, if we do not consider the equilibrium constants of formation of the inhibited complexes between the catalyst-alcohol and epoxide respectively. Since these constants are significantly higher for Rl with respect to R2 E.

By considering the different structure of the active portion of the two heterogeneous catalysts, we think it reasonable that Rl, having two carboxylic groups and two neighbouring amino-groups provides a stronger binding than R2, in which two amidic groups and only one carboxy group are present. This assumption seems justified since using the same model equation the same trend is observed with two non-macromolecular model compounds (I) and (II) known to be excellent homogeneous catalysts. Further work is in progress in order to better understand the employed mechanistic assumptions. 4. Conclusions From the above results the following conclu- sions can be drawn: (1) Mo(VI) complexes of crosslinked resins having poly(thioetheramidoacids) as the active portion can be easily prepared by standard techniques. (2) The site of Mo(VI) complexation may be tentatively attributed to the carboxy groups, possibly with the participation of neighboring amido-groups. (3) By IR spectroscopy it has been possible to correlate the peroxo-groups of the cited complexes to their catalytic activity. 74 E. Tempesti et al. 1 Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 67-74 (4) An original equation has been used to compare the observed kinetic behavior relative to known homogeneous catalysts.
