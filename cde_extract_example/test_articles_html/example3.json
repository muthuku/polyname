Mailka-Solich *, A. Macionga, R. Trczyn Institute of Polymer Chemistry, Silesian Technical University, PI-44-100 Gliwice, Poland Received August 30, 1994; Accepted December 12, 1994 Abstract The 3,4-dihydro-2,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-carbaldehyde (methacrolein dimer) 1 was oxidized at 20-60 with air in the presence of polymeric Mn(II), CO(II) and Cu(II) complexes. The 3,4-dihydro-2,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2carboxylic acid 2 formed at the first stage of oxidation undergoes self condensation with 1 to a monoester of hemiacetal 3. Gradual addition of hydroxyl groups of 3 to the vinyl-ether groups of 3 resulted in the formation of a mixture of cyclic oligo(acetal-esters) 5 (14-, 21- and 28-membered rings).

Introduction Currently, there is great interest in the synthesis of the oligosaccharides as many observations are suggesting important biological roles for these sugar chains composed of linked monosaccharides. The chemical synthesis of oligosaccharides, although well-developed over the last years, presents many problems. More attention has been directed towards chemical synthesis of polysaccharide analogues by ring-opening polymerization of bicyclic acetals, bicyclic oxalactam, bicyclic lactones [1-3]. Polysaccharide-type polymers derived from bicyclic compounds containing a tetrahydropyran ring are prepared by the chemical reactions of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-carbaldehyde * Corresponding author. 1381-5148/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved. SSDI 1381-5148(95)00005-4 (acrolein dimer). Okada and coworkers found that acrolein dimer, after oxidation to 3,4dihydro-2H-pyran-2-carboxylic acid, may be transformed to reactive monomers. Polymerization of these bicyclic compounds under properly selected reaction conditions gave highly selective macrocyclic oligomers, or linear polymers. The 3,4-dihydro-2,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2carbaldehyde (methacrolein dimer) 1 containing two methyl groups at C-2 and C-5 in the 3,4dihydropyran ring offers a wide variety of stereochemical aspects of the reactions involved in the synthetic route leading to the functionalized hexopyranans. This paper describes the first example of the specific oxidation of 1 in the presence of polymeric Mn(11), Cu(1I) and Co(II) complex. The oxidation of methacrolein dimer can be directed toward the aldehyde group or the vinyl ether double bond. 36 J. MaSlika-Solich et al. /Reactive & Functional Polymers 26 (1995) 35-41 As a polymeric matrix for the preparation of catalysts, the copolymers: (a) of pinene-maleic acid-crosslinked with 1,6-hexamethylenediamine (PIN-MA-HMDA); (b) ethyl vinyl ethermaleic acid-crosslinked with 1,6-hexamethylene diamine (EtEV-MA-HMDA) or 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (EtVE-MA-DADPM); and (c) terpolymer of ethyl vinyl ether-maleic acidvinyl acetate cross-linked with a 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (EtEV-MA-VA-DADPM), have been applied. Polymeric carboxylate ligands were used to prepare various complexes of Co(II), Mn(II), and Cu(II) ions. Activity of these polymeric complexes was examined in the oxidation of methacrolein dimer 1 in the liquid phase. 2. Experimental 2.1.

Preparation of polymeric Mn(H), Co (H) and Cu(II) complexes Maleic anhydride copolymer of pinene was synthesized by the procedure previously described [4]. Copolymer ethyl vinyl ether-malefic anhydride and its terpolymer with vinyl acetate were prepared according to the procedure described in the literature [5]. The crosslinked structure of copolymer was prepared by the reaction with hexamethylene- 37 1,6-diamine (HMDA) and 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane (DADPM). Polymeric metal complexes were prepared according to the standard procedure. The metal contents were 8.6% Mn, 15.1% Cu, 7.6% Co. 2.3.6. General procedure of oxidation of methacrolein dimer 1 The oxidation of methacrolein dimer 1 (10 g) with air proceeds in the oxidizing tube, where air is bubbled through the feed layer at room or elevated (30-60) temperature. The air flow rate is controlled by a rotameter. The oxidation process was controlled by the determination of the acid and saponification number of the oxidized products (mg KOH/1 g sample). The mixture of products was distilled into fractions (b.p. 40-55/4 mmHg; 65-90/ 4 mmHg; 108-121 /4 mmHg, solid residue was washed with cold n-hexane and dried in vacuo). 3. Results and discussion The series of oxidations of 3,4-dihydro-2,5dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-carbaldehyde 1 were carried out by air stream at 20, 30 and 60 with polymeric catalyst. An independent experiment without catalyst was also carried out under similar conditions. Table 1 shows the parameters of the oxidation of 1. After completion of oxidation the low molecular compounds were distilled off and the oligomers were precipitated in cold hexane and filtered off. The liquid fractions and hexane filtrate were analyzed by the GC-MS technique. Catalytic activity was also observed by determining the parameters characterizing the oxygen-containing compounds (functional numbers: acid, hydroxyl, bromine, saponification). Distillation of the products gave fractions containing relatively high value of ester groups (liquid fraction b.p. 108-121/4 mmHg) with ester number equaling 495-558 mg KOH/g. The examination of the content of ester group in oligomers (solid state) has shown to be in the 38 J.

A gas chromatograms GC-MS of the liquid products revealed the formation of 2,5-hexadione, 2-formyl-2-methyl-5-oxo-hexanoic acid and higher boiling compound with molecular weight equals to 296. The solid products were analyzed by GPC (Table 2). All reaction products were analyzed by chemical and spectral analysis. A representative 1HNMRspectra of oxidation products without separation are presented in Fig. 1. The 1 H-NMR spectra of higher boiling fractions (108-120/3 mmHg) and solid products present a set of peaks of aliphatic protons at 0.8-2.4 ppm, acetal protons at 4.6-4.9 ppm, and proton singlets at 8.1 and 8.22 ppm (formyl protons). The evidence for the formyl ester, acetal groups was also confirmed by 13 C-NMR spectra (160, 105-95, 70-65 ppm). 3.1.

Because the aldehyde group in 1 is susceptible to oxygen, carboxylic acid is formed as a first stage of oxidation. Additions of 3,4-dihydro-2,5dimethyl-2H-pyran-2 carboxylic acid (2) to the carbonyl group of methacrolein dimer 1 probably result in major products of self condensation type 3. (Fig. 2). Fourie and Riesser [6]described that acrolein dimer with acetic acid at 60 in the presence of a strong acid catalyst gave 7-acetoxy2,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane. The authors proposed the general scheme of this reaction, in which the monoester of hemiacetal of acrolein 39 dimer was the probable intermediate. By analogy, the methacrolein dimer with 3,4-dihydro2,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-carboxylic acid 2 yields the hemiacetal-ester 3 which, under mild acidic conditions (carboxylic groups in polymeric matrix), gives rise of gradual addition of hydroxyl groups of 3 to vinyl-ether groups and leads mainly to a mixture of cyclic oligo(ester-acetals) (Table 2). As model compounds to test this idea, the reaction of methacrolein dimer with benzoic acid and 3,4-dihydro-2,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2carboxylic acid under mild reaction conditions were chosen. Only the product of reaction 1 with benzoic acid was isolated in a crystalline, pure form. The solution structure of 10 being investigated by NMR (1H and t3C) and VPO is in accordance with the proposed scheme of cyclic oligo(acetal-esters) formed in the oxidation of 1. Minor by-products (with high values of saponification number 495-558 mg KOH/g), are also formed, possibly by the oxidation of vinyl-ester group of 1 to the hydroperoxide 6 (Fig. 3). The hydroperoxide is probably transformed into 2-formyl-2-methyl-5-oxo-hexanoic acid 7 and its addition products. Further oxidation of compound 7 gives rise of its decomposition to hexandione 2, carbon monoxide and water. The degree of decomposition of 7 was to be higher (65% of overall conversion) in the absence of the catalyst when compared to poly (PIN-MA)Mn(II) (7.85%). The presence of acetoxy and formyl groups in the macrocyclic products (see Fig. 1) has been suggested for the oxygen attack on the 3,4-dihydro-2,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-yl substituent in oligo(acetal-esters). The yields of cyclic oligo(acetal-esters) and by-products depends on the nature of catalyst and on reaction temperature. Performing the reaction at lower temperature (20-30) results an increase in 28-membered macrocyclic oligo(acetal-esters), and decrease the yield of compound 7 and other by-products. 40 J.

The 3,4-dihydro-2,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-carboxylic acid 2 formed at the first stage of oxidation undergoes self condensation with 1 to a monoester of hemiacetal 3. Gradual addition of hydroxyl groups of 3 to the vinyl-ether groups of 3 resulted in the formation of a mixture of cyclic oligo(acetal-esters) 5 (14-, 21- and 28-membered rings).", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "1995-09-30", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/138151489500005Z", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ma\u015bli\u0144ska-Solich, J."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Macionga, A."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Turczyn, R."}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/138151489500005Z"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/138151489500005Z"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "1381-5148(95)00005-Z", "prism:volume": "26", "prism:publisher": "Published by Elsevier B.V.", "dc:title": "Polyaddition of 3,4-dihydro-2,5-dimethyl-2H-pyran-2-carbaldehyde by metal complexes", "prism:copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 1995 Published by Elsevier B.V.", "prism:issueName": "Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Polymer Supported Reactions in Organic Chemistry", "openaccess": "0", "prism:issn": "13815148", "prism:issueIdentifier": "1-3", "dcterms:subject": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Methacrolein dimer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Oxidation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Polymeric complex"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Maleic acid copolymer"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Cyclic oligo(acetal-ester)"}], "openaccessArticle": "false", "prism:publicationName": "Reactive and Functional Polymers", "prism:number": "1-3", "openaccessSponsorType": null, "prism:pageRange": "35-41", "prism:endingPage": "41", "pubType": "fla", "prism:coverDisplayDate": "September 1995", "prism:doi": "10.1016/1381-5148(95)00005-Z", "prism:startingPage": "35", "dc:identifier": "doi:10.1016/1381-5148(95)00005-Z", "openaccessSponsorName": null}, "link": {"@rel": "abstract", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/0029370541"}}
