      "  <dc:description>In the present study, poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate (EGDMA)-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) microspheres (150–200 μm in average diameter) were produced by suspension copolymerization of EGDMA and HEMA in an aqueous medium. Toluene was included in the formulations in order to produce water-swellable microspheres. Poly(vinylalcohol) and benzoyl peroxide were used as stabilizer and initiator, respectively. Alkali Blue 6B was attached to the microspheres, as a metal chelating ligand for specific adsorption of heavy metal ions. These dye attached microspheres were characterized by optical microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. Adsorption/desorption of cadmium(II) ions from aqueous solutions on these sorbents were investigated in batch equilibrium experiments by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The rate of interaction between Alkali Blue 6B and cadmium(II) was very fast (15–60 min). The maximum cadmium(II) adsorption onto the dye-attached microspheres (i.e., by complex metal chelate formation) was about 5.43 mg cadmium(Il)/g polymer, which was observed at pH = 6.7. While adsorption onto the plain poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres (i.e., nonspecific adsorption) was about 0.93 mg cadmium(Il)/g polymer at the same conditions. Up to 92% of the adsorbed cadmium(II) ions was desorbed in 2 h using 0.1 M HN03 (pH = 1.0) as an eluant. The resorption capacity of the sorbent did not significantly decrease during repeated sorption-desorption cycling.</dc:description>\n",

Introduction The selective and quantitative separation of metal ions from aqueous solutions have been extensively investigated by applying several techniques [1-3]. Amongst them, approaches where specific sorbents are used have been considered as one of the most promising techniques [4-6]. Specific sorbents consist of a ligand (e.g., ionexchange material or chelating agents) which * Corresponding author.

SSDI 1381-5148(05)00069-0 interacts with the metal ions specifically, and a carrier matrix which may be an inorganic material (e.g., aluminium oxide, silica, activated carbon or glass) or polymer microspheres (e.g., polystyrene, cellulose, poly(maleic anhydride) or polymethylmethacrylate) [7-10]. As carrier matrices, polymer microspheres have attracted the most attention because they may easily be produced in a wide variety of compositions, and modified into specific sorbents, by introducing a variety of ligands. Synthetic polymers have almost entirely displaced inorganic car- 200 B. Salih et al. /Reactive &amp; Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 199-208 riers, with few exceptions in the separation of heavy metal ions [11-14]. Nonporous or porous polymer microspheres with average diameter of usually more than 100 gm are used in these applications. In order to increase the active surface area available for attachment of the ligands, therefore for specific adsorption, porous polymeric microspheres are preferentially utilized. There are commercially available polymer based porous sorbents which exhibit surface areas 100250 m2 or even larger per gram of sorbent [151. One of the most critical points in the use of porous sorbents is their pore structure. Because, the pore diffusion and the surface area in the pores determine adsorption rate and capacity, respectively. Sorbents with highly open pore structures are needed for high adsorption rates. However, high active surface area of the porous sorbents is mainly due to the fine pores in the matrix, which are not available for large molecules. In other words, large molecules cannot penetrate within these fine pores and therefore cannot use the active surface area there, which means low adsorption capacities for large molecules. As conclusion it can be said that the optimization of pore structures of the carrier matrices is a very important issue to achieve both high adsorption rates and high adsorption capacities. Recently, we have produced water-swellable poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) microspheres with different sizes and swelling abilities [16]. In order to introduce specificity against to heavy metal ions we proposed to covalently attach a new ligand, i.e., Alkali Blue 6B to these microspheres. We studied adsorption/desorption of cadmium ions to these specific sorbents in batch experiments. Results of these initial studies are presented here. 2. Experimental 2.1. Preparation of dye-attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres Ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate (EGDMA) supplied from Rohm and Haas, Germany, was puri- fied by passing through active alumina. Hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) was purchased from Sigma Chem. Co., USA, and purified by the same method. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and poly(vinylalcohol) (PVAL; MW: 100,000, 98% hydrolyzed, Aldrich Chem. Co., USA) were utilized as the initiator and the stabilizer, respectively, without further purification. Toluene (Merck, Germany) was selected as the diluent and used without further purification. Dispersion medium was distilled water. Swellable poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres were produced by a modified suspension polymerization method described in detail elsewhere [l6]. In order to obtain poly(EGDMAHEMA) microspheres with an average diameter of 150-200 jLm, the following procedure was applied: the dispersion medium was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of PVAL within 50 ml of distilled water. A 12 ml toluene was mixed with 8 ml of EGDMA and 4 ml of HEMA, then 0.06 g of BPO was dissolved in this mixture. This monomer phase was then transferred into the dispersion medium placed in a magnetically stirred (at a constant stirring rate of 600 rpm) glass polymerization reactor (100 ml) which was in a thermostatic water bath. The reactor was flushed by bubbling nitrogen and then was sealed. Polymerization was conducted, first at 65 for 4 h, and then at 90 for 2 h. After polymerization, the microspheres were cleaned by following several washing steps with water and ethyl alcohol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 for 48 h [16]. For dye attachment to the po1y(EGDMAHEMA) microspheres, 10 ml of the aqueous solution containing 300 mg of Alkali Blue 6B (BDH Ltd., UK) was poured into 90 ml of the suspension of the microspheres in distilled water (containing 3.0 g of the microspheres), and then 4.0 g of NaOH was added. The medium was heated in a sealed reactor for 4 h at a stirring rate of 400 rpm, and at a constant temperature of 80. The dye-attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres were filtered, and washed with distilled water and methanol several times until all the unbound dye was removed. B. Salih et al. /Reactive &amp; Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 199-208 2.2. Characterization of dye-attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres In order to determine swellability of the poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres, first the apparent volume of the dry microspheres (10 g) was measured within a cylindrical glass tube (100 ml). Then, water was added into the tube, and the microspheres were allowed to swell at room temperature for 24 h (i.e., the predetermined equilibrium swelling time) with occasional shaking, and then the volume of the swollen microspheres was measured. The equilibrium swelling ration of the poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres were calculated by using the following expression. Equilibrium swelling ratio = V'11~t - Ydry where V,,et and Vdry are volumes of the microspheres before and after swelling, respectively. The optical micrographs were taken with the dry (nonswollen) and swollen microspheres under an optical microscope (Nikon, Alphapot YS, Japan) equipped with a dark field phase-contrast attachment. The average size and standard deviations were determined by measuring the size of 100-300 microspheres on the optical micrographs. FTIR spectra of the plain and dye-attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres were obtained by using a FTIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, FTIR 8000 Series, Japan). The microspheres (0.1 g) and KBr (0.1 g, IR Grade, Merck, Germany) were thoroughly mixed and this mixture was pressed to form a tablet, and the spectrum was recorded. 2.3. Adsorption/desorption studies Adsorption of cadmium(II) ions from aqueous solutions was investigated in batch experiments. Effects of the initial cadmium concentration and pH of the medium on the adsorption rate and capacity were studied. A 20 ml of aqueous solutions containing different amounts of 201 cadmium (II) ions (in the range of 1-125 ppm) were treated with the sorbents (i.e., the plain and the dye-attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres) at different pH (in the range of 3.26.7) (adjusted with universal buffer solution) at room temperature, in the flasks agitated magnetically at an agitation speed of 600 rpm. The concentrations of the cadmium(II) ions in the aqueous phases after the desired treatment periods were measured by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (GBC 932 AA, Australia) with a graphite furnace atomizer. The amount of adsorption per unit mass of the microspheres were evaluated by using the following expression. Q- (Co -C)~V m (2) Here, Q is the amount of cadmium(II) ions adsorbed onto unit mass of the microspheres (mg/g); CO and C are the concentrations of the cadmium(II) ions in the initial solution and in the aqueous phase after treatment for certain period of time, respectively (mg/ml); V is the volume of the aqueous phase (ml); and m is the amount of poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres used (g). Desorption of cadmium(II) ions was studied in 0.1 M HN03 solution at pH = 1.0. The microspheres containing cadmium(II) ions were placed in this desorption medium and stirred (at a stirring rate of 600 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature. The final cadmium(II) concentration in the aqueous phase was determined by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The desorption ratio was calculated from the amount of cadmium(II) ions adsorbed on the microspheres and the final cadmium concentration in the desorption medium, by using the following expression. Desorption ratio = amount of cadmium(II) ions desorbed x 100 amount of cadmium(II) ions adsorbed (3) 202 B. Salih et al. /Reactive &amp; Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 199-208 Fig. 1.

Characteristics of dye-attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres The poly(EGDMA-HEMA) matrix prepared in this study is a cross-linked hydrophilic network, i.e., an hydrogel. Therefore it does not dissolve in aqueous media, but it does swell, depending on the degree of cross-linking and on the hydrophilicity of the matrix [16]. The equilibrium swelling ratio of the microspheres produced with the recipe given in the previous section was obtained as 55% by using the expression given in Eq. 1. The dry poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres are opaque (white in colour) (Fig. lA), which is an indication of the porosity in the matrix, as a result of the diluent (i.e., toluene) used in 203 the polymerizations [16]. However, the opacity of the microspheres significantly decreased and the colour of the microspheres became light blue, when the microspheres were allowed to swell in water (Fig. 1B). After the attachment of the dye (i.e., Alkali Blue 6B) the size of the swollen microspheres did not change, but the colour became blue, which is a clear indication of the incorporation of the dye molecules in the structure of the poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres (Fig. 1C). In order to show incorporation of Alkali Blue 6B within the poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres, FTIR spectra of the plain, Alkali Blue 6B and dye-attached microspheres were taken (Fig. 2). The bands observed at 1075 cm-1, 1160 cm-1, 1280 cm-1, and 3610-3750 cm-l represent symmetric stretching of S=O, asymmetric stretching of S=O, aromatic C-N vibration and N-H and S03H groups, respectively, as also V 4000 2000 1500 1000 400 Wave Number (cm-1) Fig. 2.

These bands may be considered as another indication of the incorporation of Alkali Blue 6B molecules within the poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres. We assume that the dye molecules were attached to the polymer matrix by covalent bond- S03 H 5 4 n 3 2 ing. The condensation reactions between the amino groups of the dye and the hydroxyl groups of the polymer matrix were occurred. FTIR spectra given on Fig. 2 may be used to indicate these reactions. Note that the C- N stretching absorption occurs in the region from 1350 to 1000 cm-1 as a medium to strong band for all amines. Aliphatic amines (e.g., the amine groups on the covalent bonds between the dye and the polymer matrix) absorb from 1250 to 1000 cm-t, while aromatic amines (e.g., the amine groups on the dye molecules) absorb from 1350 to 1250 cm-l (see Fig. 2). 3.2. Adsorption of cadmium(II) ions Fig. 4 shows adsorption rates of cadmium(II) ions onto the dye-attached poly(EGDMAHEMA) microspheres from aqueous solutions containing different amounts of cadmium(II) ions (in the range of 1-125 ppm) at constant pH of 6.7.

Salih et al. l Reactive &amp; Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 199-208 sion given Eq. 2. As seen here, high adsorption rates are observed at the beginning, and then plateau values (i.e., adsorption equilibrium) are gradually reached within 15-60 min. Adsorption of cadmium(II) was quite fast, especially when the cadmium(II) ion concentration was high. This may be due to high driving force, which is the cadmium(II) ion concentration difference between the liquid (i.e., adsorption medium) and the solid (i.e., the microspheres) phases, in the case of high cadmium(II) ion concentration. Several experimental data on the adsorption kinetics of cadmium by various sorbents have shown a wide range of adsorption rates. For example, recently, Reed and Matsumoto have considered 6 hours as a short equilibrium time in their cadmium adsorption kinetic studies, in which they have used activated carbon as sorbent [3,17]. Konishi et al. have investigated recovery of zinc, cadmium, and lanthanum by biopolymer gel particles of alginic acid. In their recent paper, they reported very high adsorption/desorption rates for lanthanum by alginic acid, in which 205 equilibrium was achieved in about 60-90 min [18]. Note that in such an adsorption process, there are several parameters which determine the adsorption rate, such as agitation (or flow) rate in the aqueous phase, sorbent structural properties (e.g., size, porosity, surface areas), amount of sorbent, metal ion properties (e.g., hydrated ionic radius), initial concentration of metal ions, chelate-formation rate, and of course existence of other ions which may compete with the ions of interest for the active adsorption sites. All individual experimental study published in the literature has been performed at different conditions, therefore, it is almost impossible to compare the adsorption rates reported. Fig. 5 shows effects of initial concentration of cadmium(II) ions onto the adsorption capacity of the dye-attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA). Note that this graph was obtained by using the plateau values (corresponding the equilibrium time of 90 min) given in Fig. 4.

Salih et al. l Reactive &amp; Functional Polymers 27 (1995) 199-208 creased first with the initial concentration of cadmium(II) ions then reached a plateau value (5.43 mg cadmium(II)/mg polymer) at about an initial cadmium(II) ions concentrations of 125 ppm, which represents saturation of the active points (which are available for cadmium(II) ions) on the microspheres. The maximum adsorption capacity of the Alkali Blue 6B attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres is 5.43 mg cadmium(II)/g polymer. Some previous data on the sorption equilibria of cadmium for aqueous solutions by natural and synthetic polymers have been compared by Konishi et al. [18]. These data and other reported values [3,5,17,19,20] were again in a very wide range (4.8-96.3 mg cadmium/g sorbent), in which initial concentration of the cadmium in solution was in the range of 0.056-2.81 mg/L. The extend of adsorption increased by the initial metal ion concentration as expected similar to our data shown in Fig. 4. It is well-known that cadmium adsorption both on nonspecific and specific sorbents is pH dependent [3,5,17,19,20]. In the absence of com- plexing agents, the hydrolysis and precipitation of the metal ions are affected by the concentration and form of soluble metal species. The solubility of cadmium is governed by hydroxide or carbonate concentration. As discussed in detail by Boomhower [21] and Reed and Matsumoto [3], hydrolysis of cadmium becomes significant at around pH = 8. The theoretical and experimental precipitation curves indicate that precipitation begins above pH = 7, which also depends on the concentration of cadmium in the medium. Therefore, in our study, in order to establish the effect of pH on the adsorption of cadmium(II) ions onto the dye-attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres, we repeated the batch equilibrium studies at different pH in the range of 3.2-6.7. In this group of experiments, the initial concentration of cadmium(II) ions and the adsorption equilibrium time (i.e., time to reach the plateau, as seen in Fig. 4) were 125 ppm and 90 min, respectively. Fig. 6 shows both nonspecific adsorption (i.e., adsorption onto the plain poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres) and the specific adsorption (i.e., s Alkali Blue Attached Poly(EGDMA HEMA) 5 4 n 3 N 2 3 Poly(EGDMA HEMA) 4 Medium pH Fig. 6.

As seen in Fig. 6, adsorption of cadmium increased with increasing pH. Optimal pH value was considered as 6.7. The nonspecific adsorption of cadmium(II) ions was low, about 0.93 mg cadmium/g polymer. There is neither ion exchange nor complex-forming groups onto the plain poly(EGDMA-HEMA) inicrospheres. This adsorption may be due to diffusion of cadmium(II) ions into the swollen matrix of the microspheres. While the specific adsorption of cadmium(II) ions, which was pH dependent, was much higher (up to 5.43 mg cadmium(II)/g polymer) than nonspecific adsorption. High adsorption at basic pH values implies that cadmium(II) ions interact with Alkali Blue not only through the nitrogen atoms (see Fig. 3) by chelating, but also through -S03H groups by cation exchange, which are unprotonated at high pH. 3.3. Desorption of cadmium (H) ions Desorption of the adsorbed cadmium ions from the Alkali Blue 6B attached poly(EGDMAHEMA) microspheres was also studied in a batch experimental set-up. The dye-attached microspheres loaded (at pH = 6.7) with different amounts of cadmium(II) ions were placed within the desorption medium containing 0.1 M HN03 at pH = 1.0 and the amount of cadmium(II) ions desorbed in 2 h was measured. The desorption ratio was then calculated by using the expression given in Eq. 3. Table 1 summarizes the results of desorption studies. As seen in this table recovery (or desorption ratio) was very high (up to 92%) with the eluant system and conditions used. 3.4. Repeated use In order to obtain the reusability of the dye attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres, sorption-desorption cycle was repeated 5 times by using same sorbent. Fig. 7 shows these data. As seen here, resorption capacity of the sorbent 207 Table 1 Desorption of cadmium(II) ions (adsorption medium pH 6.7; desorption medium: 0.1 M HN03, pH = 1.0) Initial cadmium(II) ions concentration (ppm) 0.5 5 25 50 100 125 Desorption ratio a (%) 86.0 f 0.3 92.0 f 0.5 91.0 f 0.2 89.0 f 0.1 90.1 f 0.3 91.2 f 0.3 a Mean and standard deviation of three experiments. did not significantly decrease during repeated sorption-desorption cycling. 4. Conclusion From the data presented here it can be concluded that the Alkali Blue 6B attached poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres may effectively (means with high adsorption rates and capacities) be used for removal of cadmium(II) ions from aqueous solutions. Our studies related to adsorption/desorption of other heavy metal ions (e.g., Cu 2+, Pb2+, He+, Zn2+) from different matrix systems (i.e., different aqueous media) are still under investigation.

In the present study, poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate (EGDMA)-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) microspheres (150–200 μm in average diameter) were produced by suspension copolymerization of EGDMA and HEMA in an aqueous medium. Toluene was included in the formulations in order to produce water-swellable microspheres. Poly(vinylalcohol) and benzoyl peroxide were used as stabilizer and initiator, respectively. Alkali Blue 6B was attached to the microspheres, as a metal chelating ligand for specific adsorption of heavy metal ions. These dye attached microspheres were characterized by optical microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. Adsorption/desorption of cadmium(II) ions from aqueous solutions on these sorbents were investigated in batch equilibrium experiments by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The rate of interaction between Alkali Blue 6B and cadmium(II) was very fast (15–60 min). The maximum cadmium(II) adsorption onto the dye-attached microspheres (i.e., by complex metal chelate formation) was about 5.43 mg cadmium(Il)/g polymer, which was observed at pH = 6.7. While adsorption onto the plain poly(EGDMA-HEMA) microspheres (i.e., nonspecific adsorption) was about 0.93 mg cadmium(Il)/g polymer at the same conditions. Up to 92% of the adsorbed cadmium(II) ions was desorbed in 2 h using 0.1 M HN03 (pH = 1.0) as an eluant. The resorption capacity of the sorbent did not significantly decrease during repeated sorption-desorption cycling.
